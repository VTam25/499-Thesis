Issues of concern include performance, scalability, functionality, and manageability. Our research aims at developing the protocols, system architecture, and underlying principles for these systems. Our approaches range from highly experimental systems research, to modeling and measurement, to theory. Our research areas include protocol design, wireless and mobile networks, disruption tolerant networks, sensor networks, WWW protocols and content distribution networks, embedded systems, real-time and multimedia systems, network algorithmics, performance modeling and analysis, network measurement, virtualization, storage and file systems, and autonomic computing.
