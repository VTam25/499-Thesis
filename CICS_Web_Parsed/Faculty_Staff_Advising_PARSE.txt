Faculty/ Staff in the event you are concerned about a student Submit a Student of Concern form to CICS Advising If you are concerned about a CICS student, please inform the CICS Advising Office by completing the Student of Concern form . The student's advisor will be notified and will reach out to the student to check-in and offer support. This form is an appropriate step for non-emergent situations. However, for immediate crisis response, please first refer to the Dean of Students (information below) and/ or CCPH. We ask that you then also submit this form to our office so that we know what is going on and can also follow up with the student. Thank you! Resources The Dean of Students' office can offer support for students and has its own Student Support Request & Referral process. This office has also compiled Frequently Asked Questions, as well as crisis resources into a comprehensive Maroon Folder. https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/student-life/student-life-faqs-facultystaff https://www.umass.edu/dean_students/student-support-request-referral https://www.umass.edu/umatter/sites/default/files/Maroon_folder-digital-2021.pdf The UMass Center for Teaching and Learning offers guidance in how to support students academically, and designing an inclusive syllabus. https://www.umass.edu/ctl/resources/how-do-i/how-do-i-write-inclusive-syllabus https://www.umass.edu/ctl/resources/how-do-i/what-should-i-do-first-weeks-help-students-succeed-my-class https://www.umass.edu/ctl/programs/map-program Student Affairs and Campus Life has compiled a frequently used staff resources, numerous resources regarding diversity and active inclusion, and single-stop resources for students in need of specific assistance. https://www.umass.edu/studentlife/faculty-staff https://www.umass.edu/studentlife/faculty-staff/active-inclusion https://www.umass.edu/studentlife/single-stop Search form Search CICS Current Students CICS Advising Undergraduate Advising MS Program Advising Faculty/ Staff Graduate Students Undergraduate Students Courses Career Development CICS Writing Center Student Organizations
