CS Lab Science Requirement for Biology Biology Variance: Due to changes in the Biology curriculum, the CS Undergraduate Program and Curriculum Committees have approved that following Biology courses for the CS Lab Science Requirement for the BS, depending on when a student joined the CS Major. The Biology Department may require CS Majors to request overrides for BIOL 151, 152, and 153.  The allowance of these biology courses is no guarantee that you will get a seat.  The Biology Department makes the final decisions on override requests for their courses. Joined CS Major after May 2014 A student may use all three Introductory Biology courses (BIOL 151, BIOL 152, and BIOL 153; total of 10 credits) to satisfy the 8 credits required for the CS Lab Science Requirement (CSLSR).  The ARR will need to be fixed by Program Staff to accept these 3 courses for the CSLSR.  Once all 3 courses are completed, you may email upd@cs.umass.edu (not required) and we will note that you are opting for the Biology Variance and fix your ARR prior to your major clearance for graduation. Joined CS Major prior to May 2014 The following Biology courses may be used to satisfy a CS Lab Science Requirement for the BS (or the Revised BS 2016*): BIOL 110 Introductory Biology for Science Majors Spring 2013 and Spring 2014 offerings ONLY.  No exceptions. AP Credit posted for BIOL 110 between Summer 2012 through Spring 2014. Either BIOL 110 or BIOL 151, but not both. BIOL 151 Introductory Biology I Either BIOL 110 or BIOL 151, but not both. BIOL 152 Introductory Biology II BOTTOM LINE: Look at your Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. *Students who entered the CS Major before May 2014 are eligible for the Biology Variance under the revised BS as well, even if the ARR does not show Biology courses.  We will update ARRs for eligible students, however, if you entered the CS Major before May 2014 and you believe that your ARR is incorrect, then email upd@cs.umass.edu and request a review.
