Make a Gift The new, signature building for the UMass Amherst Manning College of Information and Computer SciencesÂ is substantially funded by a $75 million capital investment from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition to seeking private donations for the construction of the building, we are seeking support for our academic and student support programs, including financial aid, experiential learning, and undergraduate research. Contact Ed Welch , executive director of development, to learn more about giving and naming opportunities and how you can help open a door for our students. Make a Gift
