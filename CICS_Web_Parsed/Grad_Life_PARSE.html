The College strives to provide students not only with a world-class education but also with the unique experience that comes from being a member of our diverse community of learners. In this section, you will find information about orientation for incoming MS and PhD students as well as other information that will be helpful as you begin your life as a graduate student here at UMass Amherst. Getting to Amherst UMASS Visitors Center University Health Services The mandatory health fee and student health benefit plan are mandatory. Students are billed in the fall for the period of August 1 to January 31 and in the spring for February 1 through July 31. For enrollment in the SHBP for the fall semester, it's highly recommended that you submit the Enrollment Form to patientservices@uhs.umass.edu in late June or early July. For the spring semester, it's best to submit the enrollment form in December. You must be registered for at least one credit or have paid the continuous enrollment fee for your enrollment form to be processed. If you haven't registered yet, Patient Services will hold your enrollment form until you do, but processing will be delayed. SHBP members must print out a new insurance card every academic year. Family plan enrollments must be renewed every semester by filling out the Enrollment Form and the Affidavit of Domestic Partnership . Send these forms to patientservices@uhs.umass.edu by the end of the add/drop period. Graduate Student Tuition Bills The Bursar's office manages student payments and provides updated tuition rates. Graduate student bills are adjusted after the add/drop period ends and calculated according to the number of credits the student is enrolled in. Students who drop courses after the add/drop period ends will receive a reduced refund or no refund depending upon the date of withdrawal. Bills are due several weeks after the add/drop period ends. For students receiving tuition waivers please allow several weeks after the start of the semester for bills to be adjusted. For students receiving scholarship or fellowship funds which will cover the balance of your tuition and fees, do not sign up for GEO payroll deduction because it will freeze any balance you should receive until the end of the semester. If you have questions about when you will receive your excess amount from a scholarship or fellowship please email Eileen Hamel at ehamel@cs.umass.edu.
