Electronic Teaching Faculty W. Richards Adrion, Professor Emeritus Ivon Arroyo, Associate Professor James Kurose, Distinguished Professor Emeritus Tim Richards, Senior Teaching Faculty Beverly Woolf, Research Professor Related Centers and Labs Center for Knowledge Communication Research in Presentation Production for Learning Electronically Electronic Teaching involves computational systems that communicate and cooperate with learners at many levels. These systems might use the World Wide Web or CD/DVD-ROM and asynchronous learning environments to provide lectures outside the classroom. They might provide customized responses and on-demand advice through intelligent interfaces, inference mechanisms and cognitive models of the learner. Much of the machine teaching research in computer science is multi-disciplinary, with strong ties to research in cognitive science, education, engineering, and to other computer science researchers in artificial intelligence, networking, machine learning, information retrieval and multimedia. Target applications include undergraduate and K-12 curricula, as well as industrial and medical training. Dozens of systems and courses have been deployed and evaluated, with tens of thousands of users across dozens of universities.
