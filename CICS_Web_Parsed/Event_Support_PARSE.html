Completing these steps will help ensure that your event runs smoothly and that Manning CICS staff can best support you. 1.

Complete the room reservation form . Note: submitting this form implies that you are accepting the usage guidelines posted below, along with the full conference room guidelines . 3. Complete the event promotion request form to submit your event to the CICS web calendar or post a digital sign. Conference Room Information Room Reservations/Cancellations The CICS Dean and Chair's Office has priority over the use of the rooms. Requests will be processed during normal business hours and should be put in a minimum of two business days before the event. One-person room requests will be automatically placed in our one-person meeting booths. If a one-person meeting is requested for a multi-person conference room, that reservation may be bumped for larger meetings. To cancel a room that has been reserved, contact room-reservations@cs.umass.edu in advance of the meeting time. Guidelines for use Conference rooms should not be used without a reservation. Conference room tables must not be moved. Chairs must be returned to their original position and pushed in neatly. If food/drink has been brought into the room ( only allowed in CS 150 ), you are responsible for wiping down the tables and removing all the trash from the room. Key Access If a key needs to be signed out for a specific room (for after-hours access, e.g.), please have the meeting organizer come to CSCF in the CICS building, room CS126, during normal business hours.
