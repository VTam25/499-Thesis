Explore the Building Located on the north side of campus, the UMass Amherst Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences’ new building will sit between the college’s two existing facilities—the Computer Science Building and the Lederle Graduate Research Center Lowrise— creating a center of activity for UMass Amherst computing along Governors Drive. With low-carbon Mass timber construction, on-site solar array and a planned connection to a nearby geo-thermal well field, the building will prioritize low energy use, minimize the use of fossil fuels, and serve as a model for the UMass Carbon Zero initiative.
