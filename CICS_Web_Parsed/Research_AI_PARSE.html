Â Current research in AI includes automated planning, autonomous systems, computational neuroscience and bio-computation, computer vision, heuristic search, intelligent tutoring systems, knowledge discovery and data mining, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, probabilistic modeling and inference, reinforcement learning, robotics and human-robot interaction, search engines and search tools, sequential decision making and optimization. Applications include mobile robots that collaborate with people in an office environment, semi-autonomous driving, planning tools to protect endangered species, discovering trends in news and social media, K-12 tutoring systems, and reading the text of outdoor signs.
