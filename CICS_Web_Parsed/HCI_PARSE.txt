By tapping into the power of our visual processing system, data visualizations -- maps, infographics, flow charts, word clouds, and network diagrams -- can massively enhance our ability to analyze and understand patterns in order to make data-driven decisions. Information visualization researchers examine how people interpret and communicate data.
