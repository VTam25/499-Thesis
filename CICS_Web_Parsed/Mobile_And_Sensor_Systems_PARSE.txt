Our research at UMass Amherst works on the design of novel low-power sensing systems with applications to mobile health, a next-generation Internet that is focused on seamless support for mobility and trustworthiness, and efficient and low-power wireless connectivity. Current projects include the design of ultra-low power radios for wearables, new wearable technologies such as low-power eye trackers to monitor health signals, and robust detection of important health targets such as drug use, smoking, and over-eating.
