M.S. Concentration in Data Science MS students wishing to add the Data Science Concentration to their MS degree are asked to submit the pre-application and are required to: Complete 30-course credits meeting the Data Science Course Requirements (courses taken to satisfy core/elective/statistic requirements are included) Satisfy all MS in CS core / course requirements (courses taken to satisfy Data Science requirements are included) Satisfy 4 Data Science Core Requirements Satisfy 2 Data Science Elective Requirements Satisfy 1 Data Science Statistics Requirement DATA SCIENCE COURSE REQUIREMENTS Core requirements. You must have satisfied four Data Science core requirements (one from each of three areas, plus one additional requirement from any of the three areas). This requirement is usually satisfied by taking courses and getting a B or better in them. Elective Requirements. You must have satisfied two Data Science elective requirements Statistics Requirement. You must have satisfied one Data Science statistic requirement Credits. You must take a total of 30 credits with the following restrictions: No more than 18 of the course credits may come from courses at the 500 level. 500-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. At least 12 of those credits must come from courses at the 600-900 level that are not independent studies. 600-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. No more than 12 credits may come from independent studies No more than 9 credits may come from courses outside of the Computer Science Department. (Credit for graduate courses from other departments must be approved by the GPD.) No more than 6 credits may be taken pass/fail Classes with a grade below a C may not be counted toward the MS degree. Only a limited number of credits may be transferred from other programs or institutions. GPA. Your overall grade point average for those 30 credits must be 3.0 or higher.
