C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Bay_State_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/bay-state-scholarship-program,"Bay State Scholarship Program For the strongest computer science undergraduates at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as at the participating five-colleges , the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences offers students three special scholarship opportunities to enter its Master's of Science in Computer Science degree program. The Bay State Master's Program provides a tuition scholarship worth approximately 10% of the MS tuition. In addition, the Graduate School will waive the application fee for applicants who are currently enrolled as undergraduates at UMass Amherst (or one of the Five College campuses). The Bay State Scholars Program builds upon the Bay State Master's Program and provides a tuition scholarship worth approximately 50% of the MS tuition for students who meet the requirements outlined below. The Bay State Fellowship Program builds upon the Bay State Scholar's Program by providing a 10 hour per week teaching assistantship, a full tuition waiver, and a 95% waiver for health fees. Unlike the Master's and Scholar's programs, above, the Bay State Fellowship program is competitive. A short CICS application is required for entry to this program. The College expects to award at least eight Bay State Fellowships annually. How does the MS program work? The computer science Master's degree is a 30 credit hour residential program. The degree can consist of ten 3 credit classes, or eight classes, along with a 6 credit master's project. Student coursework must also include 4 core classes across three areas. Up to six credits of previous work -- for example, graduate courses taken while an undergraduate not used to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements -- may be applied to the 30 credit MS requirement. Courses may be taken during the summer. Requirements and Qualifications To be eligible for the program, a current undergraduate must be completing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science or Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and must have taken at least 15 of the College's required 20 technical courses at the Amherst campus (and thus transfer students are eligible to participate in the program). Undergraduates from other majors are encouraged to apply to our MS degree program, but the Bay State scholarship program is not available to majors outside of computer science (i.e. informatics, math computing, math & stats, linguistics etc.). Application Process Bay State Masters and Scholars: The application is closed for the Fall 2024 start term. If you are in your final semester please start the college internal application process once the form opens.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\BSCS_Requirements_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/revised-bs-requirements-effective-september-2023,"B.S. in Computer Science - Fall 2023 Requirements Revision This page describes the B.S. in Computer Science degree requirements that apply to new incoming students and on-campus students starting the major in Fall 2023 and later. Program requirements for students who started the CS major between Fall 2016 and Spring 2023 are available here . Overview The computer science undergraduate program provides a solid foundation in the science of computing. To earn a bachelor's degree, the University requires that a student successfully complete a minimum of 120 credits with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (A=4.0). The program is built around seven core lower-division computer science courses (total credits = 28), eight upper-level computer science electives (total credits = 26-28), four mathematics courses (total credits = 14), and two approved laboratory science courses (total credits = 8). These courses supply the essential theory, concepts, and techniques in the major areas of computer science and related disciplines. The degree includes courses required by the major program, college and university. Students may have satisfied some of these requirements before entering the University (see "" Credit for Prior Coursework ""). Others may need additional preparation, such as a math review course, before they begin this program. Note that each set of requirements is administered by a different authority. Requirements for the major are administered by the Computer Science Undergraduate Program, and the Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director is the final authority on whether these are fulfilled. College and University requirements are administered by the College of Information and Computer Sciences Academic Deans Office and the University Registrar's Office. Students should check their ""Academic Requirements Report"" (also referred to as the ARR) on SPIRE to determine which requirements have been satisfied. When does a course count for the CS major? A computer science major may not use any course taken on a pass/fail basis to fulfill the computer science program requirements (including mathematics, lab science, and computer science introductory, core, and upper-level elective courses). Students must maintain an average grade of at least C (2.0) in all courses used to satisfy the major degree requirement (see major GPA on the ARR).  While courses with grades of C-, D+, or D may be counted toward the degree, students normally repeat these courses so that the new grade will replace the old in their GPA calculation (Check Academic Regulations for rules about repeating courses).  A grade below C will normally not suffice as a prerequisite for a later course. For example, enrolling in COMPSCI 220 requires a grade of ""C or better"" in CICS 210. What is an approved CS elective? Any regularly numbered COMPSCI course at the 300-level or above may be used as an elective, excluding  COMPSCI 305, or if it is specifically barred as an elective in its course description. The following elective options require ARR Fixes that are generally applied after grades are finalized following your last semester: Experimental courses (x90), seminar courses (x91-x95) and special topics (x97) may only be used as CS electives at the 300- or 400-level depending on the level if specifically stated in the course description . ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. At most 3 credits of CS honors research courses (499T/P) can be used as a CS elective 400+. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. Independent studies (x96) at the 300-level (or above) are reviewed for CS elective credit via the independent study approval process during registration.  If the CS UPD approves, at most 3 credits of independent study can be used as a CS elective. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. A maximum of 3 credits of either COMPSCI 499P/T or COMPSCI 396/496/596 may be used toward CS Major requirements. Additional credits earned will count toward graduation credit requirements, but will not count toward major requirements. Degree Requirements General Education Requirements: Computer science majors complete general education requirements as specified by the University. Information on general education requirements is available here https://www.umass.edu/gened/students/fulfilling-requirements . Current students can also verify their requirements using their Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. Junior Year Writing (JYW) Requirement: Computer science majors take CICS 305 Social Issues in Computing in their junior or senior years to satisfy this requirement.  The Junior Year Writing course must be taken at UMass Amherst.  Double majors for whom Computer Science is the secondary major may use the Junior Year Writing requirement course from their primary major to fulfill this requirement. Integrative Experience (IE) Requirement: Students satisfy the University's IE Requirement by taking an approved IE course in their primary major at UMass Amherst.  COMPSCI 320 Software Engineering and COMPSCI 326 Web Programming are currently the designated IE courses for CS and also count as a CS Elective. Three Introductory Computer Science Courses CICS 110: Foundations of Programming (4 cr) CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming (4 cr) CICS 210: Data Structures (4cr) Four Core Computer Science Courses COMPSCI 220 Programming Methodology (4 cr) COMPSCI 230 Computer Systems Principles (4 cr) * COMPSCI 240 Reasoning About Uncertainty (4 cr) COMPSCI 250 Introduction to Computation (4 cr) * Note: COMPSCI 198C Introduction to the C Programming Language (a 1cr practicum course) is a prerequisite for COMPSCI 230. Four Mathematics Courses MATH 131 Calculus I (4 cr) MATH 132 Calculus II (4 cr) MATH 233 Multivariate Calculus (4 cr) or STATISTC 515 Statistics I (not a replacement for MATH 132) MATH 235 Introduction to Linear Algebra Eight Upper-Level Elective Computer Science Courses 311 Introduction to Algorithms (4 cr) (prereq: 250) 3 additional CS electives numbered 300 or above (may include one to satisfy the IE Req) 3 additional CS electives numbered 400 or above 1 additional CS elective numbered 300 or above, or an outside elective from an approved list ECE 353 Computer Systems Lab I (3 cr) ECE 547 Security Engineering (3 cr) (formerly ECE 597AB) ECE 668 Computer Architecture (3 cr) LINGUIST 401 Intro to Syntax (3 cr) MATH 411 Intro to Abstract Algebra I (3 cr) MATH 545 Linear Algebra for Applied Mathematics (3 cr) MATH 551 Intro to Scientific Computing (3 cr) MATH 552 Applications for Scientific Computing (3 cr) Residency Requirement: Five of the eight required upper-level (300+) course must be taken at UMass Amherst. Two Lab Science Courses (8 credits): Satisfy laboratory science requirement by taking two majors-level science courses in the College of Natural Sciences* that includes a lab component (8 total credits). See your Academic Requirements Report (ARR) for specific program requirements. Students select two courses from the following list---mixing departments is acceptable: CICS 256 (formerly 290M) Make: A Hands-on Introduction to Physical Computing * CHEM 111 or 121 General Chem - Science Majors CHEM 112 General Chem - Science Majors or 122 General Chemistry GEOL 101 The Earth (with lab) or GEOL 103 Oceanography and GEOL 131 Experiencing Geology (lab) or GEOL 105 The Dynamic Earth and GEOL 131 (lab)** PHYSICS 151 General Physics I or PHYSICS 181 Physics I - Mechanics PHYSICS 152 General Physics II or PHYSICS 182 Physics II - Electricity and Magnetism Options in Biology for the CS Lab Science Requirement * CICS 256 (formerly 290M) is currently open to Freshmen/Sophomore BS-CS Majors only (Juniors may be considered if available seats).  The ARR does not list the course as an option, therefore an ARR Exception will be completed closer to graduation. We will fix your ARR and you do not need to tell us. Only email upd@cs.umass.edu if you do not want to use this course. **GEO-SCI 103/131 and GEO-SCI 105/131 require an ARR Exception. In general, if your grades are lower in courses that need an ARR Fix than in other courses for this requirement, we will not update your ARR.  We will fix your ARR and you do not need to tell us. Only email upd@cs.umass.edu if you do not want to use these courses. Search form Search CICS",BSCS_Requirements_PARSE.txt

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Our_History_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/history-school-computer-science,"Our History The Early Days The '90s and '00s Leadership Computing came to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the early 1960s, as a result of the needs of the Chemistry Department. What had started as a departmental operation became formalized as the Research Computing Center (RCC), under the Directorship of Robert Rowell, and with crucial guidance from the Computer Committee, chaired by Richard Stein of Chemistry. In addition to the computing services a center could provide, it was necessary to establish an academic program to provide students with a deeper knowledge of the computer than basic programming. In 1963 the Computer Committee recommended to the Dean of the Graduate School (then Edward C. Moore) that a search for a Program Head be undertaken. As a result of that search, J.A.N. Lee was appointed Program Head in September of 1964. He was also asked to direct the RCC and to undertake the selection and installation of a new computer system. In 1964, there were four faculty: J.A.N. Lee (CS), John Goda, Sidney Rubenstein (joint appointment with RCC), and Fred Stockton (Dept. of Civil Engineering). Susan Stidham joined in 1966. “The CS program at UMass Amherst was one of the first separated programs in the United States” Lee continues, “at that time, programming was being taught in classes in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Civil Engineering at UMass Amherst primarily as graduate courses. The prime mover for creating a unified institute was Moore, with the support of those departments.” In June 1965, the Board of Trustees approved an M.S. program in Computer Science (after receiving unanimous approval by the campus Curriculum Committee in May). In September of 1965, the Program moved to new quarters and admitted its first graduate student. Lee stepped down as Director of the RCC, so that he could focus on program development. Caxton C. Foster joined the program and became Director of the RCC. At this stage, the Program and the Center became formally distinct entities within the Graduate School despite the joint appointments. “Besides trying to coordinate the various departmental courses to maintain some level of achievement, the primary tasks of the group were to develop new courses that would allow for fulfilling the requirements for the M.S. degree that had been approved,” notes Lee. “The first two approved courses were Numerical Analysis and Compilers."" ""There was no lack of candidates for the M.S. program, and many students supplemented their undergraduate curriculum with CS courses, though at that time it was not an approved minor.” Conrad Wogrin was recruited from Yale to become the Director of the renamed University Computing Center (UCC), succeeding Foster in 1967, and also held a professorship in the Program. In 1967, James Bouhana became the first M.S. graduate. A major factor in putting the University of Massachusetts on the map in the computer world was the development, under Foster’s guidance, of a timesharing system acronymically known as UMASS (Unlimited Machine Access from Scattered Sites). Along with Foster, David Stemple and Bob Hambleton were instrumental in getting the first timesharing system operational in 1967. With the increasing demands on RCC computer time, however, it became clear that the students could not get sufficient “hands-on” experience using the RCC machines. To this end, a Computer Science Laboratory was established in 1968, as a facility run jointly with the Computer Systems Engineering faculty in the Department of Electrical Engineering. The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system. In November 1969, Lee stepped down as Head of the M.S. Program, having directed the creation of a first-rate, highly practical, industry-oriented M.S. Program in Computer Science. “Those first five years did set the base for a developing activity which eventually led to departmental status and new degree programs,” says Lee. “Our reputation in the industry and academia was excellent.” The time seemed ripe to push for approval of a Ph.D. Program, but the first proposal failed to gain approval because of an insufficient emphasis on doctoral level research. Wogrin assumed the Acting Headship, and the responsibility for the search for a new Chair to oversee a successful second try. He recruited Michael Arbib from Stanford, where Arbib was then an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering. Arbib became Chair of the Program in September 1970. He met with all faculty members interested in computer science across campus to chart their interests. Then, he structured the Ph.D. proposal around three themes: Systems (building on the strengths of Lee and Foster), Theory of Computation, and Cybernetics (Brain Theory and Artificial Intelligence). With the help of Mort Appley, Dean of the Graduate School, and Wogrin, the proposal moved up through the UMass administration in Amherst before going to the UMass Board of Trustees in Boston, where Councilor Troy proved a strong supporter. The Ph.D. proposal was approved in January of 1972 along with an upgrading from an M.S. Program in Computer Science in the Graduate School to a Department of  Computer and Information Science (COINS) offering both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. In 1972, there were nine COINS faculty:  Michael Arbib, Richard Eckhouse, Caxton Foster, William Kilmer, J.A.N. Lee, Edward Riseman, Susan.N. Stidham, Robert Taylor, and Conrad Wogrin. Grant activity in FY73 was $169,588. A letter to grad students described the housing costs in 1972: “Generally, apartments are very expensive — $150 for a one bedroom apartment is a typical price.” In an article celebrating the program’s 25th anniversary, Wogrin noted, “We had an identity even back in our early years. When the ACM was celebrating their 25th anniversary in the early 70s, Cax Foster and Michael Arbib had articles in the anniversary issue of the ACM Communications journal. This was a strong showing as there were only a very select group of invited articles.” In 1972, the University opened the (Lederle) Graduate Research Center, and the new Department became an anchor tenant of the low rise building, along with the Graduate School, the Science Library, and the University Computing Center. The Department graduated its first Ph.D. student, Suad Alagic, in February of 1974. In 1978, the undergraduate major in COINS was established under the leadership of Robert M. Graham, who succeeded Arbib as Chair in September of 1975. The department developed not only as a center of excellence in computer science (“one of the 20 departments in the top 10,” as Arbib put it) but also as a nexus for interdisciplinary research, with a Center for Systems Neuroscience, the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics, and the Cognitive Science Program. In addition, it started to grow expertise in computer systems, adding faculty in networking, distributed systems, databases, information retrieval, and software engineering, and in theory, adding faculty in complexity theory and algorithms. By 1980, there were 90 graduate students, 80 undergraduates, 12 faculty, and a Research Computing Facility based on Digital Equipment Corporation’s VAX 11/780. Enrollment in COINS courses was 2180 in FY80 and grant income was $665,608. Under the leadership of Edward Riseman (Chair from 1981-1985), the Department had phenomenal growth during the 1980s. Riseman’s strategy for recruiting new faculty whose research overlapped with the research of others in the Department had tremendous bearing on the success and camaraderie that CS enjoys today. Wogrin became Acting Chair in 1985 until Rick Adrion was recruited in 1986 to become the next COINS Chair, a position that he held until 1994. Highlights of 1990s and 2000s In 1990, COINS, in collaboration with the computer science departments of all the State colleges and universities, formed the Massachusetts Computer Science Education Consortium (MCSEC) to improve computer science education throughout the Commonwealth. Also in 1990, the first Issue of the Department’s newsletter, Loose Change, was published. In 1991-1992, over $23 million in federal/state/industry support was secured for a number of programs:  the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR), the Center for Autonomous, Real-Time Systems (CARTS), Project Pilgrim, and a DoD/URI Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence. Each of these projects was initially under the umbrella of the Center for Real-Time and Intelligent Complex Computing Systems (CRICCS), which began with an NSF/CII grant in 1991. The Computer and Information Science Department changed its name to the Department of Computer Science in March 1992. In 1997, the Sidney Topol Distinguished Lecturer Series was started, and the following year, the Department initiated the Bay State Fellows program. In Fall 1999, the Department of Computer Science moved to its current home, the Computer Science Research Center, located at 140 Governors Drive. At the time of the move, the Department had 37 faculty (tenure track plus research), 164 graduate students, 403 undergraduates, and 97 technical and administrative staff. Grant activity was $13 million in FY2000. In 2000, the Board of Higher Education funded the Commonwealth Information Technology Initiative (CITI) with UMass Amherst in the lead. CITI works to improve IT education across MA public higher education and promote “IT across the curriculum.” That same year, The UMass IT Program was established with the IT minor as its major education program. The Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science became an official program in Fall 2010. In Fall 2012, the Department of Computer Science became the School of Computer Science, signaling the recognition by the campus both of the excellence of the computer science faculty as well as the increasingly central role that computer science plays within UMass, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the nation. On April 8, 2015, the UMass Board of Trustees approved the change from the School of Computer Science to the College of Information and Computer Sciences.

This course may count as a major elective for computer science and informatics majors with UPD approval, subject to program rules that apply to independent study courses. Through ERSP, students have the opportunity to learn about research, improve and apply core computing knowledge, gain skills important to their futures as computer and information scientists, and work closely with our amazing faculty mentors and a supportive group of peers in ERSP. EMBER: Energizing, Mentoring, and Broadening Exposure to Research EMBER (Energizing, Mentoring, and Broadening Exposure to Research) is a cross-institutional 1-credit class for undergraduates studying computer science or informatics at UMass Amherst and Mount Holyoke College, usually taken during junior year. Space permitting, seniors may also take the course. An overarching goal is to make research opportunities available and accessible to students from populations that are underrepresented in computing. The course includes a mini-research module mentored by PhD students where undergraduates carry out real experiments. These 4–5 week research modules are designed to be accessible for students regardless of previous research exposure, and to teach new skills through carrying out research projects. The weekly meetings cover a range of topics, including building networks and community in computing, research methods and skills, strategies for navigating graduate school applications, and developing basic research communication skills. Both writing and presentation skills are practiced so that students can be effective in referencing their EMBER experience in job, fellowship, and/or graduate school application letters. CICS Careers Undergraduate Research Volunteers The Undergraduate Research Volunteer (URV) Program is an opportunity for undergraduate students to pursue real-life applications of research. URVs work in teams of three and are assigned one PhD mentor, affiliated with a CICS Lab. Over the course of this program, teams have worked on projects related to differential privacy, environmental justice, and more. URV alumni have acquired positions in both industry and REUs. Independent Study with CICS Faculty If you become interested in a research area being investigated by a faculty member, we encourage you to reach out to the faculty member to discuss the possibility of undertaking an independent study on a related project. Projects are usually for 3 credits a semester. Very successful independent study projects may lead to a second semester of independent study. Students must check course requirements to assure their  independent study courses fulfill their degree requirements. Commonwealth Honors College Honors Thesis For students in the Commonwealth Honors College, an honors thesis can be a great way to get involved with faculty research. As with an independent study, the student and faculty member must agree on a suitable project. The student, with advice from their faculty mentor, must complete the required Honors College Thesis Application. The honors thesis will take the form of a written report that demonstrates critical thinking, a mastery of disciplinary material, and the communication of complex ideas. For the portfolio, your document will be accompanied by an artifact such as a computer program or invention that embodies the work done for the thesis. The completion of an Honors Thesis concludes with an oral presentation. CICS Undergraduate Research Scholarships These scholarships provide financial support to a limited number of students to pursue a research project under the direction of one or more CICS faculty members. These projects can be pursued as independent study courses, as an honors thesis for students in the Commonwealth Honors college, or as full-time summer or part-time academic-year paid positions. Priority will be given to students from minoritized groups in computing (i.e., Black, LatinX, women, LGBTQIA, Native Americans, or Pacific Islanders). Priority will also be given to projects that are addressing important societal issues and are aimed at improving the common good. National Research Opportunities for CICS Undergraduates Summer REU Programs Summer is a great time to engage in research. The National Science Foundation’s REU program funds summer research opportunities in computing at over 90 sites for US citizens or permanent residents. The Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation (CRA-WP) Distributed REU (DREU) program provides funding for research with faculty members across the US for students from underrepresented groups in computing, and has some limited opportunities for international students.
