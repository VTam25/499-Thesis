C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Accelerated_MS_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/accelerated-masters-computer-science,"Accelerated Master's in Computer Science The Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences offers a five-year program that allows students to obtain a Bachelor of Science (BS) in computer science and a Master of Science (MS) in computer science in five years. Program Structure Students enrolled in the Accelerated MS program will take four graduate-level COMPSCI courses prior to graduating with their undergraduate degree. All four of these courses will count towards the MS degree, with two of them also counting towards the BS degree. After completing their undergraduate studies, students will take six courses to complete the MS degree requirements. This is completed in one year (two semesters). Students may take independent study credits or complete an MS project in addition to regular courses. Eligibility The Accelerated MS program is open to computer science BS or BA undergraduate students at UMass Amherst who meet the following two criteria: At least 3.6 overall GPA (grade point average) upon application to the program Students who have a 3.5 GPA may apply for a pending status and have an end of semester GPA review B+ or higher in COMPSCI 311 Students who did not earn a B+ in  COMPSCI  311 may use 501, 514, 575, or 589 with a B. Will have completed two eligible graduate courses to double count and two eligible graduate courses to transfer. Students who do not meet this requirement may apply for the Bay State Scholarship and the MS in computer science degree program without the accelerated option. Application and Admission Process Students should apply in the second semester of their junior year (the semester prior to their final two semesters of their undergraduate program). Students who do not meet the minimum requirements during the second semester of junior year can apply in the first semester of their senior year or final semester , as long as the following criteria are met: B+ in COMPSCI 311 3.6 overall GPA On track to complete four eligible 500 or 600 level courses to count toward the MS degree. Applications automatically include eligibility review for the Bay State Scholarship , a multi-tiered program that provides tuition assistance for the MS program to computer science undergraduates from UMass Amherst and the Five Colleges. Accelerated students will receive only two semesters of the Bay State Scholarship or Fellowship. APPLY NOW Application Deadlines March 28 prior to a student's senior year (two semesters remaining) October 1 prior to a student's senior year (two semesters remaining) Same dates apply for students who apply in the first or second semester of senior year. Decisions are made within 30 days of the deadline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Are the BS and MS degrees offered through this program the same as the individual BS and MS degrees? Yes, the BS and MS degrees offered through this program are identical to the individual BS and MS offered by the college. All degree requirements for the BS and MS degrees must be met. The Accelerated MS program does not affect the requirements for either one of these degree programs or any other dual-degree program. How much of my MS tuition will the Bay State scholarship apply to? The Bay State scholarship will apply to the remaining 18 credits you take after completing your undergraduate studies. If you choose to take more than 18 credits as an MS student, the Bay State scholarship will only apply to 18 of those credits. Scholarships will be awarded in two equal payments. What is the GPA requirement? In order to be eligible for the Accelerated MS program, students must have an overall GPA of 3.6 or higher at the time of application, and complete their undergraduate studies with an overall GPA of 3.6 or higher. Accepted students who do not complete their undergraduate studies with an overall GPA of 3.6 or higher will not be allowed to double-count the two undergraduate courses towards the MS degree. Is the GPA requirement of 3.6 or higher cumulative or major only? The GPA requirement of 3.6 or higher is overall/cumulative, not major only. Can I apply during the first semester of my senior year? Yes. See the Application and Admission Process section for details on the eligibility criteria for senior-year applicants. If you are not on track to complete the four graduate-level COMPSCI courses prior to graduation, then you will not be eligible for the Accelerated MS program or to double count any courses. You would only be eligible to apply to the traditional MS program and transfer at most six credits. Do I also need to apply to UMass Graduate School? Once accepted into the Accelerated MS program, you will need to submit a graduate school application during the semester prior to graduation. The graduate academic programs staff will send you instructions about when to submit your Bay State Scholarship application and graduate school application. You will not need to submit letters of recommendation/references, statement of purpose/personal statement, and you will not have to pay the application fee. Do I need to have completed COMPSCI 311 before applying? Yes. You need a B+ or higher in COMPSCI 311 in order to be eligible for the Accelerated MS program. COMPSCI 311 cannot be in progress when you apply. Is the Accelerated MS program open to informatics students who have taken COMPSCI 311? No, the Accelerated MS program is open to computer science BA and BS majors only. How many courses can I double count towards my BS and MS? Students accepted into the Accelerated MS program can double count two courses towards their BS and MS degrees. A course cannot count toward two majors and the MS degree. Do the double-counted course bring the grades with them into the graduate program? Yes, your grade for the double-counted courses will transfer into the Master's program as a letter grade and will be included in your graduate GPA. Can I double count a course that I received a P in? Yes, an undergraduate course that you received a P in can be counted towards your accelerated Master’s program, and it will transfer to the Master’s program with the underlying grade. The P will remain on your undergraduate transcript. Can I double count a course that I have also double counted for a double major or minor? No, a course can only be used for a maximum of two credentials. If you double count a course towards two majors, or a major and a minor, it can not count towards the accelerated MS in computer science program. Who will my advisor be during my last two semesters of my undergraduate studies? You will keep your undergraduate advisor. The advisor for the MS program will be kept informed of your progress in the graduate-level courses. Can the MS degree be completed online? Yes, you can choose to complete the MS degree online after you finish your undergraduate studies. However, the Bay State Scholarship does not apply to online courses. Not all graduate-level courses are available online each semester, so you may have fewer options for your final (fifth) year if you choose to complete your degree online. If my GPA is under 3.6 in the second semester of my junior year, can I apply in the first or second semester of my senior year? Yes, you can apply during the first or second semester of your senior year. You will be eligible for the Accelerated MS program then if your overall GPA is 3.6 or higher, you have taken two graduate-level CS courses, and completed COMPSCI 311 with a B+. Will I be able to remain in the MS program beyond one year if I choose to? Yes, you may continue in the program beyond the two semesters, but your Bay State Scholarship will no longer apply to credits beyond 18. Will I be able to transfer or double count graduate courses outside of computer science? Yes, courses outside of computer science that have been pre-approved for the MS degree can be considered for transfer and/or double counting. Can I defer my enrollment in the Accelerated MS program? No. If accepted, you must matriculate into the Accelerated MS program immediately following the completion of your undergraduate program. You may not defer enrollment to a future semester, or begin the Accelerated program after there has been one or more semesters off following your undergraduate completion. You may defer your enrollment in the MS program, but then you would not be able to use the accelerated benefits.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\BACS_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/ba-degree-requirements,"B.A. in Computer Science - Overview The College of Information and Computer Sciences has an interdisciplinary Bachelor's of Arts (BA) degree in Computer Science that was started in Fall 2010. The BA degree gives students the chance to study computer science with more room to pursue interdisciplinary interests through a four-course outside concentration. This degree is particularly appropriate for students who are interested in combining Computer Science with another discipline as a double major. These web pages provide details about the BA requirements. If you have questions, you may visit the CS Undergraduate Advising Center during posted hours, or contact upd@cs.umass.edu. Major changes into CS are by application only.  If you are interested in joining our major, submit your application.  If you have questions after reviewing the process, please contact the appropriate list on our Contact Us With Your Questions page. If you are already a CS Major and want to switch between BS and BA, talk with your advisor and fill out a "" program change "" form. Finally, students completing the Computer Science BA (or BS) and a Math major or minor will find some helpful advice on this page . BA requirements Requirements for Students Starting Fall 2023 and Later: In Spring 2023, the Faculty Senate approved a revision to the BA in Computer Science that will be effective starting September 2023. These requirements apply to students who start in the CS BA in September 2023 and later (or until the program is revised again). BA MAJOR Requirements - 2023 Revision BA TRACKING Form - 2023 Revision is to be used by all students who pursue the BA to track progress. Four-course outside concentration and how to submit courses for UPD review/approval. Requirements for Students Starting Spring 2023 and Earlier: In Spring 2023, the Faculty Senate approved a revision to the BA in Computer Science that will be effective starting September 2023. Students who started the BA in Spring 2023 and earlier follow the requirements listed below. Note that the 2023 revision updated the CICS introductory course sequence. The old introductory courses COMPSCI 121, 186 and 187 are no longer being offered as of fall 2023. For more information, including the details of grade replacement, see the CS Introductory Course Revision web page . BA MAJOR Requirements BA TRACKING Form is to be used by all students who pursue the BA to track progress. Four-course outside concentration and how to submit courses for UPD review/approval. The tracking forms are informal descriptions of the programs that are for guidance only, and they do not define official policy.  See Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. When does a course count for the CS major? A computer science major may not use any course taken on a pass/fail basis to fulfill the computer science program requirements (including mathematics, lab science, and computer science introductory, core, and upper-level elective courses). Students must maintain an average grade of at least C (2.0) in all courses used to satisfy the major degree requirement (see major GPA on the ARR).  While courses with grades of C-, D+, or D may be counted toward the degree, students normally repeat these courses so that the new grade will replace the old in their GPA calculation (Check Academic Regulations for rules about repeating courses).  A grade below C will normally not suffice as a prerequisite for a later course. For example, enrolling in COMPSCI 220 requires a grade of ""C or better"" in COMPSCI 187. What is an approved CS elective? Any regularly numbered COMPSCI course at the 300-level or above may be used as an elective, excluding CICS 305 (formerly COMPSCI 305), or if it is specifically barred as an elective in its course description. The following require ARR Fixes which may be updated closer to graduation: Experimental courses (x90), seminar courses (x91-x95) and special topics (x97) may only be used as CS electives at the 300- or 400-level depending on the level if specifically stated in the course description.  *Only 3 credits of a CS Capstone courses (499T/P) can be used as a CS elective 400+ (see NOTE). ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. Independent studies (x96) at the 300-level (or above) are reviewed for CS elective credit via the independent study approval process during registration.  If UPD approved for major requirements, *only 3 credits of independent study can be used as a CS elective (see NOTE). ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE. NOTE:  *Only 3 credits of either COMPSCI 499P/T or COMPSCI 396/496/596 may be used toward CS Major requirements. 'SAVING' A COURSE FOR A GRADUATE PROGRAM. CS Majors sometimes 'save' CS 500-level+ courses to use for a graduate program.  Courses saved must not be used for any requirements for the undergraduate degree (gen ed, college, major, minor, honors, including counting toward the 120 credits; 150 for a dual degree).  If you would like to 'save' a CS500-level+ course for a graduate program, then email upd@cs.umass.edu and tell us your plan.

Program requirements for students who started the CS BA degree between Fall 2016 and Spring 2023 are available here . Overview The B.A. in Computer Science degree requires 12 computer science courses, three math courses, and a four-course outside concentration. The B.A. requires fewer math and computer science courses than the B.S. in computer science , allowing students to explore interdisciplinary interested through the four course outside concentration. The degree includes courses required by the major program, college and university. Students may have satisfied some of these requirements before entering the University (see "" Credit for Prior Coursework ""). Others may need additional preparation, such as a math review course, before they begin this program. Note that each set of requirements is administered by a different authority. Requirements for the major are administered by the Computer Science Undergraduate Program, and the Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director is the final authority on whether these are fulfilled. College and University requirements are administered by the College of Information and Computer Sciences Academic Deans Office and the University Registrar's Office. Students should check their ""Academic Requirements Report"" (also referred to as the ARR) on SPIRE to determine which requirements have been satisfied. When does a course count for the CS major?

Students must maintain an average grade of at least C (2.0) in all courses used to satisfy the major degree requirement (see major GPA on the ARR).  While courses with grades of C-, D+, or D may be counted toward the degree, students normally repeat these courses so that the new grade will replace the old in their GPA calculation (Check Academic Regulations for rules about repeating courses).  A grade below C will normally not suffice as a prerequisite for a later course. For example, enrolling in COMPSCI 220 requires a grade of ""C or better"" in CICS 210. What is an approved CS elective? Any regularly numbered COMPSCI course at the 300-level or above may be used as an elective, excluding  COMPSCI 305, or if it is specifically barred as an elective in its course description. The following elective options require ARR Fixes that are generally applied after grades are finalized following your last semester: Experimental courses (x90), seminar courses (x91-x95) and special topics (x97) may only be used as CS electives at the 300- or 400-level depending on the level if specifically stated in the course description . ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. At most 3 credits of CS honors research courses (499T/P) can be used as a CS elective 400+. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. Independent studies (x96) at the 300-level (or above) are reviewed for CS elective credit via the independent study approval process during registration.  If the CS UPD approves, at most 3 credits of independent study can be used as a CS elective. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. A maximum of 3 credits of either COMPSCI 499P/T or COMPSCI 396/496/596 may be used toward CS Major requirements. Additional credits earned will count toward graduation credit requirements, but will not count toward major requirements. Degree Requirements General Education Requirements: Computer science majors complete general education requirements as specified by the University. Information on general education requirements is available here https://www.umass.edu/gened/students/fulfilling-requirements . Current students can also verify their requirements using their Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. Junior Year Writing (JYW) Requirement: Computer science majors take CICS 305 Social Issues in Computing in their junior or senior years to satisfy this requirement.  The Junior Year Writing course must be taken at UMass Amherst.  Double majors for whom Computer Science is the secondary major may use the Junior Year Writing requirement course from their primary major to fulfill this requirement. Integrative Experience (IE) Requirement: Students satisfy the University's IE Requirement by taking an approved IE course in their primary major at UMass Amherst.  COMPSCI 320 Software Engineering and COMPSCI 326 Web Programming are currently the designated IE courses for CS and also count as a CS Elective. Three Introductory Computer Science Courses: CICS 110: Foundations of Programming (4 cr) CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming (4 cr) CICS 210: Data Structures (4cr) Three core Computer Science courses selected from: COMPSCI 220 Programming Methodology COMPSCI 230 Computer Systems Principles* COMPSCI 240 Reasoning Under Uncertainty COMPSCI 250 Introduction to Computation * Note: COMPSCI 198C Introduction to the C Programming Language (a 1cr practicum course) is a prerequisite for COMPSCI 230. Five Computer Science Electives: Five computer science electives at the 300-level or higher (not including 305) are required. These must be chosen from the department's regularly numbered courses 300 or higher. Experimental classes (numbered x90 through x99) may be used as electives only with Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director (CS UPD) approval. In special cases, courses taken outside the College of Information and Computer Sciences may be used if approved by the CS Undergraduate Program Director. Three Math Courses: Three math courses are required including MATH 131-132 plus one additional math course to be approved by the department. Appropriate courses include RES-ECON 211, RES-ECON 212, STATISTC 240, STATISTC 501, STATISTC 515, or any other Math course at the 200-level or higher. Equivalent courses or appropriate AP exam placements are acceptable in place of MATH 131-132. Four-Course Outside Concentration: Four courses forming a focused study in another discipline (or, where appropriate, more than one discipline) with relevance to the theory or practice of computer science. Typically these courses are required for the other discipline, and are at the 200 level or higher (thus they may require preliminary coursework at a lower level as prerequisites for the concentration). Individual concentrations may be created with approval of the CS UPD, based on the relationship of the concentration to the study of computer science, and its cohesiveness and depth. At most one course in the concentration may be a sixth CS elective, or the fourth course in the CS core. These options require CS UPD approval that the course contributes significantly to the overall thrust of the concentration. For help putting together a concentration , please speak directly to your advisor. To receive approval for your concentration, please work with your CS advisor and submit eligible courses.  The deadline for obtaining final CS UPD approval is before registration for your last semester Senior Year. Advising holds will be placed preventing enrollment in October for spring registration; March for fall registration. Once the Four-Course Concentration is approved by the CS UPD and you have completed the courses, your Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE will be updated.  Modifications to an approved concentration are not generally approved. GPA Requirement: A computer science major may not use any course taken on a pass/fail basis to fulfill the BA requirements. Moreover, a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or better must be achieved in courses required for the major. Residency Requirement: At least three of the five Computer Science Electives must be taken at UMass, Amherst. At least five of the nine courses consisting of the five Computer Science electives and the four-course Outside Concentration must be taken at UMass Amherst. College Foreign Language Requirement: The College of Information and Computer Sciences requires all BA degree students to complete foreign language requirement as either: (1) fourth level of one language or (2) third level of one language and second level of another. Often the work you have done in high school counts towards and completes these requirements. If you already speak a second language, another option is to ""challenge the exam"" of a fourth-level language course and have the requirement waived. Note that the situation is different for students completing a double major (120 credits total) composed of some other primary major and the Computer Science BA.  If the primary major doesn't require foreign language study, then the student does not need to complete the foreign language requirements for the Computer Science BA. For example, if the double major is composed of a Math BS as the primary major and the Computer Science BA as the second major, there would be no foreign language requirement. Students completing a double degree (150 credits total) of Math BS and Computer Science BA do need to complete the Foreign Language requirements for the Computer Science BA. Search form Search CICS"

These web pages provide details about the BS requirements. If you have questions, you may visit the CS Undergraduate Advising Center (ACE) during posted hours, or contact upd@cs.umass.edu. Major Changes into CS are by application only.  If you are interested in joining our major, submit your application.  If you have questions after reviewing the process, please contact the appropriate list on our Contact Us With Your Questions page. If you are already a CS Major and want to switch between BS and BA, talk with your advisor and fill out a "" program change "" form. Finally, students completing the Computer Science BS (or BA) and a Math major or minor will find some helpful advice on this page . CS BS Requirements Requirements for Students Starting Fall 2023 and Later: In Spring 2023, the Faculty Senate approved a revision to the BS in Computer Science that will be effective starting September 2023. These requirements apply to students who start in the CS BS in September 2023 and later (or until the program is revised again). BS MAJOR Requirements - 2023 Revision BS TRACKING Form - 2023 Revision is to be used by all students who pursue the BS to track progress. Requirements for Students Starting Between Fall 2016 and Spring 2023: The Faculty Senate approved a revision to the BS in Computer Science that became effective in September 2016. These requirements apply to students who started in the CS BS between Fall 2016 and Spring 2023. In Spring 2023, the Faculty Senate approved a revision to the BS in Computer Science that will be effective starting September 2023. Note that the 2023 revision updated the CICS introductory course sequence. The old introductory courses COMPSCI 121, 186 and 187 are no longer being offered as of fall 2023. For more information, including the details of grade replacement, see the CS Introductory Course Revision web page . BS MAJOR Requirements - 2016 Revision BS TRACKING Form- 2016 Revision is to be used by all students who pursue the BS to track progress. Tracking forms are informal descriptions of the programs that are for guidance only, and they do not define official policy.  See Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. WHEN DOES A COURSE COUNT FOR THE CS MAJOR? A computer science major may not use any course taken on a pass/fail basis to fulfill the computer science program requirements (including mathematics, lab science, and computer science introductory, core, and upper-level elective courses). Students must maintain an average grade of at least C (2.0) in all courses used to satisfy the major degree requirement (see major GPA on the ARR).  While courses with grades of C-, D+, or D may be counted toward the degree, students normally repeat these courses so that the new grade will replace the old in their GPA calculation (Check Academic Regulations for rules about repeating courses).  A grade below C will normally not suffice as a prerequisite for a later course. For example, enrolling in COMPSCI 220 requires a grade of ""C or better"" in COMPSCI 187. WHAT IS AN APPROVED CS ELECTIVE? Any regularly numbered COMPSCI course at the 300-level or above may be used as an elective, excluding CICS 305 (formerly COMPSCI 305), or if it is specifically barred as an elective in its course description. The following require ARR Fixes which may be updated closer to graduation: Experimental courses (x90), seminar courses (x91-x95) and special topics (x97) may only be used as CS electives at the 300- or 400-level depending on the level if specifically stated in the course description.  *Only 3 credits of a CS Capstone courses (499T/P) can be used as a CS elective 400+ (see NOTE). ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. Independent studies (x96) at the 300-level (or above) are reviewed for CS elective credit via the independent study approval process during registration.  If UPD approved for major requirements, *only 3 credits of independent study can be used as a CS elective (see NOTE). ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE. NOTE:  *Only 3 credits of either COMPSCI 499P/T or COMPSCI 396/496/596 may be used toward CS Major requirements. SAVING A COURSE FOR A GRADUATE PROGRAM CS Majors sometimes 'save' CS 500-level+ courses to use for a graduate program.  Courses saved must not be used for any requirements for the undergraduate degree (gen ed, college, major, minor, honors, including counting toward the 120 credits; 150 for a dual degree).  If you would like to 'save' a CS500-level+ course for a graduate program, then email upd@cs.umass.edu and tell us your plan (during your senior year and/or last semester before grades are finalized). The only thing that may change if you 'save' a course is your CS Major GPA and this is only seen on the ARR.  All courses will still show on your transcript and count toward your overall GPA.  Saving a course is an option to transfer a course to a graduate program if that program will accept the course.  Some students think that the CS Major GPA is more important and choose not to 'save'.  The CS Major GPA only includes courses counting toward the major requirements, so any courses either 'saved' or not used are excluded.  Changes are not allowed after students are cleared for graduation.

Program requirements for students who started the CS major between Fall 2016 and Spring 2023 are available here . Overview The computer science undergraduate program provides a solid foundation in the science of computing. To earn a bachelor's degree, the University requires that a student successfully complete a minimum of 120 credits with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (A=4.0). The program is built around seven core lower-division computer science courses (total credits = 28), eight upper-level computer science electives (total credits = 26-28), four mathematics courses (total credits = 14), and two approved laboratory science courses (total credits = 8). These courses supply the essential theory, concepts, and techniques in the major areas of computer science and related disciplines. The degree includes courses required by the major program, college and university. Students may have satisfied some of these requirements before entering the University (see "" Credit for Prior Coursework ""). Others may need additional preparation, such as a math review course, before they begin this program. Note that each set of requirements is administered by a different authority. Requirements for the major are administered by the Computer Science Undergraduate Program, and the Computer Science Undergraduate Program Director is the final authority on whether these are fulfilled. College and University requirements are administered by the College of Information and Computer Sciences Academic Deans Office and the University Registrar's Office. Students should check their ""Academic Requirements Report"" (also referred to as the ARR) on SPIRE to determine which requirements have been satisfied. When does a course count for the CS major? A computer science major may not use any course taken on a pass/fail basis to fulfill the computer science program requirements (including mathematics, lab science, and computer science introductory, core, and upper-level elective courses). Students must maintain an average grade of at least C (2.0) in all courses used to satisfy the major degree requirement (see major GPA on the ARR).  While courses with grades of C-, D+, or D may be counted toward the degree, students normally repeat these courses so that the new grade will replace the old in their GPA calculation (Check Academic Regulations for rules about repeating courses).  A grade below C will normally not suffice as a prerequisite for a later course. For example, enrolling in COMPSCI 220 requires a grade of ""C or better"" in CICS 210. What is an approved CS elective? Any regularly numbered COMPSCI course at the 300-level or above may be used as an elective, excluding  COMPSCI 305, or if it is specifically barred as an elective in its course description. The following elective options require ARR Fixes that are generally applied after grades are finalized following your last semester: Experimental courses (x90), seminar courses (x91-x95) and special topics (x97) may only be used as CS electives at the 300- or 400-level depending on the level if specifically stated in the course description . ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. At most 3 credits of CS honors research courses (499T/P) can be used as a CS elective 400+. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. Independent studies (x96) at the 300-level (or above) are reviewed for CS elective credit via the independent study approval process during registration.  If the CS UPD approves, at most 3 credits of independent study can be used as a CS elective. ONLY email upd@cs.umass.edu if you want to EXCLUDE one of these courses. A maximum of 3 credits of either COMPSCI 499P/T or COMPSCI 396/496/596 may be used toward CS Major requirements. Additional credits earned will count toward graduation credit requirements, but will not count toward major requirements. Degree Requirements General Education Requirements: Computer science majors complete general education requirements as specified by the University. Information on general education requirements is available here https://www.umass.edu/gened/students/fulfilling-requirements . Current students can also verify their requirements using their Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on SPIRE. Junior Year Writing (JYW) Requirement: Computer science majors take CICS 305 Social Issues in Computing in their junior or senior years to satisfy this requirement.  The Junior Year Writing course must be taken at UMass Amherst.  Double majors for whom Computer Science is the secondary major may use the Junior Year Writing requirement course from their primary major to fulfill this requirement. Integrative Experience (IE) Requirement: Students satisfy the University's IE Requirement by taking an approved IE course in their primary major at UMass Amherst.  COMPSCI 320 Software Engineering and COMPSCI 326 Web Programming are currently the designated IE courses for CS and also count as a CS Elective.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Careers_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/careers,"Committee Against Racism and for Equity (CARE) Overview and Background: What Is CARE? In 2020, Dean Laura Haas tapped over 50 faculty, students, and staff to lead our college's anti-racism efforts to identify and dismantle barriers to inclusion and equity in admissions, academic success, and the workplace—the Committee Against Racism and for Equity, or CARE. The committee quickly identified six projects to focus on for the 2020–2021 academic year. Some of those projects are now ongoing parts of CARE, some have been institutionalized or “spun off” into their own free-standing projects, and some have been folded into the four major CARE initiatives for 2021–2022. Read on to learn more about these initiatives and how you can get involved. CARE Committee Leadership Michelle Trim CARE Committee Co-Chair Senior Lecturer II & Associate Director of the Informatics Program Nader Akoury CARE Committee Co-Chair Doctoral Student, Computer Science Erika Dawson Head Director of Diversity and Inclusive Community Development 2021–2022 Projects Improving Representation Through Recruitment This group will investigate and make recommendations on our admissions recruitment processes, with a lens on how our college can become more effective in recruiting diverse students: who applies to our programs; who is accepted; and who of our accepted students enroll. Identifying Structural Barriers to Academic Success for Diverse Students Building on work by the Inclusive Teaching Committee and the Faculty Teaching Committee last year, this group will investigate and make recommendations related to academic policies and aspects of curriculum structure that present barriers to success for students from diverse and historically marginalized backgrounds. Cultural Competency Working Group Building off of work by the Microaggressions and Safe Spaces working group last year, this group will propose and develop strategies for cultural competency education in the college with an emphasis on preventing microaggressions and tone policing. Diversity Committee Antiracism Standing Reserve This group is being established for those volunteers who want to contribute, but who may not have regular availability and/or who do not have a preference for where their volunteer efforts are directed. This work couldn’t be done without the direct involvement of community members like you—the students, faculty, and staff at the heart of this work. Volunteer to be part of the CARE effort today. 2020–2021 Projects & Outcomes Committee and project chairs listed in bold.

Using these approaches, we attempt to answer important questions in molecular biology, genetics, biologically-inspired computation, and neuroscience, such as how a protein folds, how genes are expressed and regulated, how system-level behavior arises from the genetic code, how evolutionary history can inform biological processes, how biological systems are able to process information robustly, and how they learn and adapt to the environment. Our research is fundamentally concerned with efficient approaches to traverse large search spaces, perform inferences over high dimensional data sets, formally integrate diverse biological knowledge, and model biological systems and their behavior. Bioinformatics refers to the data management and processing of biomolecular data often collected on a genome-wide scale. Computational biologists and bioinformaticists typically leverage data generated by modern high-throughput assays including microarrays, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy, sequencing and other advances in biotechnology.

Many of our courses are only open to CS majors, so being added to the CS Minors List via submission of the CS Minor Intent form will allow the best service to our minors through the override registration process. Submission of the form does not guarantee course enrollment , so students pursuing the minor must be flexible when planning schedules over several semesters in order to complete the minor requirements before graduation. CS Minor Intent forms are reviewed two times a year with deadlines preceding Spring and Fall registration periods. CS Minor Intent Deadline** Registration Period Intent Form Available Added to CS Minor List March 1 for Fall 2023 (April) After Spring add/drop ends (~Feb 16 through Mar 1 5:00 PM EST) March (or May if pending predictor grades) October 1 for Spring 2024 (November) After Fall add/drop ends (~Sep 20 through Oct 1 5:00 PM EDT) October (or January if pending predictor grades) FORM AVAILABILITY: CS Minor Intent forms are available after Add/Drop ends through the stated deadline (Oct 1 or Mar 1).  Intent forms close at 5 PM EST/EDT on the stated deadline. IMPORTANT TREND: Given a trend in demand for CS courses by a steadily increasing population of CS Majors, we may not have seats for all interested students to complete the CS Minor, even for students on the CS Minor List. eligibility FOR THE CS MINORS LIST The CS Minor is subject to the Academic Regulation governing the Application of Courses towards Multiple Credentials (Sen. Doc. No. 15-030). Effective September 1, 2019, the Multiple Credentials Policy will be strictly enforced by the Undergraduate Program to ensure that no more than two courses are used to fulfill the requirements of more than one credential.  Due to significant overlap in coursework, we will no longer consider CS Engineering, Math Computing, or Computational Linguistics* majors for the CS Minor. Overall GPA of at least 3.00 required. Must be enrolled in at least COMPSCI 187 or CICS 210 and preferably MATH 131 (or MATH 132) to submit CS Minor Intent form. Completion of both CICS 160 and CICS 210 (or COMPSCI 121 and COMPSCI 187) with grades meeting the current standard (B or better) is required to be added to the CS Minors List. MATH 131 and MATH 132 are highly recommended since they are required prerequisites for half the CS core (240, 250) and subsequent upper level CS Electives (e.g., 311, 348, 370, 373, 383, 446, 513, 585) Expectation that students reserve 5 semesters to complete the CS Minor , if starting with COMPSCI 121 or CICS 110 at UMass Amherst. SPIRE EGD may impact eligibility. No course for the minor may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. (Note: does not apply for these courses taken in Spring/Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 ) At least 2.00 overall Minor GPA required for courses used for minor requirements with no more than one of these having a grade of less than a C (see below for CS minor requirements). The minor must be completed within the 10 semesters allowed for the completion of all graduation requirements, including the major. Poor performance in CS courses impacts override eligibility for subsequent CS courses. *Until Computational Linguistics is officially approved as a major, we will continue to accept Minor Intent applications from current Linguistics majors. CS Minor Intent CS MINOR REQUIREMENTS The CS minor requires five computer science courses including: CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming (or COMPSCI 121: Introduction to Problem Solving Using Computers  or equivalent) CICS 210: Data Structures (or COMPSCI 187: Programming with Data Structures or equivalent) Three COMPSCI courses for majors (200-level or higher, not including CICS/COMPSCI 305) taken at the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass-Amherst) *Note: CICS 160 is the second course in the revised CICS introductory course sequence. Students must complete CICS 110, have an eligible AP CS exam score, or pass the CICS programming placement exam to be eligible to take CICS 160. * Note: As of fall 2023, introductory programming courses COMPSCI 121 and COMPSCI 187 are no longer being offered. Of the five courses, students must take at least two computer science ""core"" courses from the following list: COMPSCI 220 Programming Methodology COMPSCI 230 Computer Systems Principles COMPSCI 240 Reasoning Under Uncertainty COMPSCI 250 Introduction to Computation There is no specific mathematics requirement for the computer science minor, but all the above courses require R1 proficiency (such as MATH 104) and COMPSCI 240 and 250 require MATH 132 as a prerequisite. A cumulative quality point average of at least 2.00 is required for all UMass Amherst courses used to satisfy the requirements for the CS minor. No courses used to satisfy the minor can be taken on a pass/fail basis. (Note: does not apply for these courses taken in Spring/Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 ) No more than one course used to satisfy the requirements for the CS Minor may have a passing grade below a C. Program questions If you would like more information about the CS Minor after reading the details about the requirements, please email askcsminor@cs.umass.edu . REGISTRATION/OVERRIDES Overrides are usually needed to register for CS courses that are restricted to majors, so if you meet prerequisites, make sure that you request an override via the on-line form for the upcoming semester (when link is available). IMPORTANT NOTE:  Students approved for the CS Minors List get some priority for seats in CS courses.  Eligible students not on the CS Minors List may still be awarded the minor if they are able to enroll in required courses via the override process, but will have a lower priority for seats. MINOR DECLARATION Undergraduate Program Staff will prepare the Declaration of an Academic Minor form for students on the CS Minors List completing requirements during each semester.  The CS Minor credential (MN-CS) is posted on SPIRE after all requirements are completed (see Student Services Center or transcript).  Students who are not on the CS Minors List who believe that they are eligible for this credential should email askCSMinor@cs.umass.edu for a transcript review.

Classically, data management has focused on structured data, but it now also includes a variety of complex data types and settings. These include textual data, semi-structured data, graph-structure data, and continuous data streams, as well as data (regardless of type) that is incomplete, imprecise, or which represents probabilistic assertions rather than known facts. Data Management research is increasingly multi-disciplinary, including aspects of theory, machine learning, operating systems, programming languages, information retrieval, and many others.  Research problems in this area focus on Developing algorithms and systems support to handle voluminous data scalably and efficiently; Representing and handling data uncertainty; Extending database functionality to support increasingly complex operations driven by modern applications; Enhancing the experience of users who interact with varied datasets for purposes of data exploration, insight discovery, and decision support; Computationally modeling text and user information needs; Supporting societal goals of privacy, diversity, and fairness in data-driven applications; Ensuring proper handling of and access to data in modern data-sharing platforms. At its core, Data Management seeks to enhance the capabilities of systems that deal with data, and, together with statistics and machine learning, is one of the pillars of the emerging discipline of Data Science.

It is used to control planes, cars, nuclear power plants, city traffic, and even to monitor wildlife. To support such a large range of applications, computer scientists learn a variety of problem solving techniques that have come to be called ""computational thinking."" Such techniques have proven to be useful even when computers are not involved in doing the computation. The goal of our program is to teach students these skills so that they can apply them to programming problems, improving the tools we use in computing, or developing programs or tools for other application areas. For students entering in Fall 2023, the introductory course sequence for the CS Bachelor's and Minor degrees consists of three classes: CICS 110: Foundations of Programming , CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming , and CICS 210: Data Structures . Students who started in Spring 2023 and earlier may have taken courses in the previous introductory sequence including COMPSCI 121, COMPSCI 186 and COMPSCI 187.  More information about the current introductory course sequence and the transition from the previous sequence can be found here: https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/cics-introductory-course-revision . Through the introductory sequence, students understand how to program a computer, how to design, develop, and test interesting software systems, and how to use many of the tools computer scientists have developed to make this as easy as possible. These courses provide the background students need to engage successfully with the COMPSCI 200-level core curriculum including COMPSCI 220: Programming Methodologies , COMPSCI 230: Computer Systems Principles , COMPSCI 240: Reasoning Under Uncertainty and COMPSCI 250: Introduction to Computation .

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Grad_Academic_Progress_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/academic-progress,"Graduate Admissions FAQ Please note: Students in terminal master's programs in the College of Information and Computer Sciences are ineligible for assistantships in the college or elsewhere on campus. Exceptions can be granted only if supported by the Chair of the Faculty and approved by the Dean of the College, in extraordinary circumstances needed to meet instructional or research needs. Q. When should I expect a decision? A. All decisions will be issued by April 1st. Q. If I choose not to submit GRE scores, will my application be negatively impacted? A. No, choosing not to submit your GRE scores will not reduce your chances of admission. Q. I'm attending a graduate program at a state college or university. Is it possible for me to transfer directly into the UMass Amherst computer science graduate program? A. You must apply to the University's Office of Graduate Admissions through the normal application procedure. However, you may request a transfer of up to six credits taken at another college or university once you have been admitted into our program (as long as those credits have not been used to satisfy the requirements for another degree). Q. I am a current CICS undergraduate student applying to the CICS MS program. Do I pay the application fee? A. No, current UMass Amherst undergraduate graduate students do not pay an application fee to any UMass Amherst master's program. Please select ""pay by check"" and the Graduate School will waive the fee. Q. What is the cost of a graduate degree at UMass Amherst? A. Most offers of admission to the PhD program will come with funding that includes a full tuition waiver. Graduate School tuition and fee information can be found here . Q. What if my scores or letters don't arrive by the application deadline? A. Applications received by the October 1st (Master's only) or December 15th deadlines will be reviewed when they are complete. If your application is submitted on time, any materials received later (e.g., TOEFL scores, transcripts, letters) will be added to the application when they arrive. Please keep in mind that this may delay the review of your application because the admissions committee will not review incomplete applications. The review process begins in October/January and our first admission decisions are made in late October for spring admission and January/February for fall admission. Q. Will the University accept copies of TOEFL scores? A. Official reports issued by ETS will be required before full processing of that application will take place. In rare instances, the Graduate School will accept certified copies of these reports. Q. I am an international applicant currently attending an American college. Will my TOEFL be waived? A. Yes, if you have earned a degree or you have current enrollment as a full-time student who will have completed two academic years of college/university work in the United States prior to the date of anticipated entrance at the University of Massachusetts. Q. Can I apply for an application fee waiver? A. We do not currently offer applicaiton fee waivers to MS students. PhD students can apply for a waiver via the Application Fee Waiver Form , which opens on November 1 of each year and closes on December 15. Q. Are the official paper transcripts necessary for my application? A. We will not review your application without at least a scanned copy of the unofficial transcripts. Upon receiving a formal acceptance to the MS or PhD program, you may mail or bring the official transcripts to the University graduate school prior to the first day of the semester you are entering. Q. Where should I send my transcripts? A. Official transcripts should be sent to the Office of Graduate Admissions, 534 Goodell Building, 140 Hicks Way, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003. Click here for more information regarding the official transcript submission process. Q. Can I defer my offer of admission to a future term? A. Yes, students who have been admitted to the MS or PhD program may defer their offer of admission up to one year in the future. Students admitted to the doctoral program must receive approval from their faculty advisor in the form of an email sent to admissns@cs.umass.edu. All graduate students who have confirmed their offer of admission will receive deferral instructions in an email and within the New Student Onboarding course page. Q. What are the average test scores and GPA of accepted applicants? A. For PhD admissions, many factors affect application success far more than the GPA, including the applicant's research experience, the strength of the recommendation letters, and the statement of purpose.  Still, our accepted students' test scores and GPA tend to be high. GRE scores are no longer required for MS or PhD applicants. We aim for all our students to have a TOEFL score above 100. Q. What are my chances of getting an assistantship (financial aid)? A. For PhD and MS/PhD track students, it is our policy to provide financial aid (assistantships) to those admitted students requesting it (with occasional exceptions). Stipends (9 month or 12 month) come in the form of Research/Teaching Assistantships. For example, stipends for the Academic Year 2022-2023 are $27,428.40 for 9 month appointments. All PhD students are guaranteed funding for the entire first year (Fall, Spring, Summer) with a stipend of $37,533.60. PhD funding is contingent upon a student making satisfactory academic progress and teaching while in their program. Effective with the cohort entering in Fall 2016, students in terminal master's programs in the College of Information and Computer Sciences are ineligible for assistantships in the college or elsewhere on campus. Exceptions can be granted only if supported by the Associate Dean and approved by the Dean of the College, in extraordinary circumstances needed to meet instructional or research needs. All MS students are eligible to apply for 4 hour per week, 15-week CICS grader appointments after their first semester. It is also worth mentioning that the cost of living is more affordable in the Pioneer Valley than urban areas which makes it easier to live on the level of support we offer. Q. I've applied to your program and was not offered admission. I would like to reactivate my application. Is this possible? A. If you wish to reapply, you'll need to submit a new application through the Office of Graduate Admissions, and pay the application fee. The application form asks whether you have previously made an application to the graduate school. In the paper form, this question is in Section II, under OTHER and on the on-line application, it's in #18. Be sure to indicate ""yes"" as well as the date or semester and year of your previous application. The College of Information and Computer Sciences keeps applications on file for two years. When your reapplication comes to our college, it will be so indicated on the front by the University's Office of Graduate Admissions. The graduate staff will then locate your file and integrate it with any new materials. Anything you wish to add must be sent through the Graduate Admissions Office. Please do not send materials directly to the College, as it only causes delays in reviewing your application. Q. If I apply to the MS/PhD program and am not admitted, will I be considered for the MS only degree program? A. We accept approximately 10-15% of our PhD applications. While we receive between 700-800 applications, we hope many of our outstanding MS/PhD applicants will consider our MS degree program. Q. I've been accepted to the MS degree program but would like to be considered for the PhD program instead. Is this possible? A. The policy of the Office of Graduate Admissions limits you to one application. You would need to withdraw your admission to the MS degree program and apply to the PhD program.  There are no guarantees of readmission to the MS degree program once the application has been withdrawn for that semester.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Grad_Life_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/life-graduate-student,"Academic Progress Students are required to make progress toward their degree each semester they are enrolled. This page describes key milestones and when in a student's program the college expects them to be completed. It also describes what a student should do if the milestones are not being met. Expected Academic Progress The college expects that MS-only students will: complete at least one core requirement per semester; and, complete the MS degree before the start of the 5th semester. The college expects that MS/PhD students will: pass the portfolio (be admitted to candidacy) by the end of the fifth semester; complete the MS degree before the start of the seventh semester; submit an approved dissertation proposal within a year after being admitted to candidacy; and, pass the final oral examination (thesis defense) before completing thirteen (13) semesters. The college expects that PhD-only students will: pass the portfolio (be admitted to candidacy) by the end of the fifth semester; submit an approved dissertation proposal within a year after being admitted to candidacy; and, pass the final oral examination (thesis defense) before completing eleven (11) semesters. In addition, the college expects that students will: enroll in six graduate credits each semester or be actively engaged in research with their advisor; complete coursework for each semester with a 3.0 or higher average; meet with their advisor each semester; make up all grades of incomplete (INC) from the previous semester; and, submit a progress report every academic semester or as otherwise required. A student who does not meet one of the milestones above must contact the Graduate Program Director to explain the situation, to describe plans for addressing the problem, and to request an extension for a designated period of time. The student's advisor will be asked to support such a request. In addition, the Graduate Program Committee requests regular progress reports from all students to ensure that unnecessary delays do not happen accidentally. Students whose progress is deemed unsatisfactory or worrisome will be notified by the Graduate Program Committee of the concerns. Depending on the specific issues, the student and advisor may need to respond as outlined above. Statute of Limitations Independent of the college's milestones for expected progress, the Graduate School defines a ""Statute of Limitations"" (SOL) deadline for thesis work to be completed. Currently the Graduate School allows three years for MS-only students and six for MS/PhD & PhD students. Statute of Limitations dates can be extended if they turn out to be too short (and they often are for PhD-only students in particular). The college monitors the deadline and arranges extensions as necessary. The Graduate School has historically been very lenient about extensions. Inadequate Academic Progress When reviewing the progress reports, the Graduate Program Committee may determine that a student's progress is sufficiently poor. If that happens, the Graduate Program Director will consult with the student, the faculty advisor, and possibly the entire faculty. As a result of those consultations, the Graduate Program Director may opt for immediate remedial action by the student, academic probation, or even a recommendation of dismissal. A student may appeal a recommendation for dismissal to the Dean of the Graduate School who will then make the final determination.

Once approved to engage in the independent study with your faculty member, complete the Graduate Independent Study Form which can be found here: online form. We recommend you submit your independent study application 3 business days before the add/drop deadline. Please Note: If the independent study form is submitted after the add/drop deadline it may take up to 10 days to be enrolled. Check out the Independent Study FAQ created for MS students by PhD Students with help and input from MS Advising and the graduate programs office. Add/drop a course The deadlines to add/drop a course, including late drop, can be found here: https://www.umass.edu/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar#spring2020 The add/drop form can be found here: https://www.umass.edu/graduate/documents/graduate-school-late-adddrop-form Students will need to fill out and obtain a faculty instructor signature on this form. Email the form to the Graduate School at gradrec@grad.umass.edu . If you have any questions please contact the Graduate Programs Assistant Kyle Skemer at kskemer@umass.edu . Waiver of Core Requirements Students who have taken courses that are nearly identical to those used to satisfy core requirements may request waivers of those core requirements using this form. The minimum grade required for a core waiver is a B in the course previously taken.  Download and complete the pdf form below. Complete a form for each waiver request. Also, if you are making multiple requests at the same time, the form must reflect the other requests. Once all sections of this form have been completed by the student, then present it to a faculty member who typically teaches the course corresponding to the core(s)you wish to have waived. Waiver of Core Requirements Form Masters project AND/OR synthesis proposal For a stand alone Masters Project, or a stand alone Synthesis Proposal, or a combined Masters Project and Synthesis Proposal please submit this on-line form .  Within the form choose the appropriate options. Portfolio report (MS/PhD or PhD-only) If you are submitting your portfolio, you may find this skeleton helpful. [ Word template ] Change in Program Request form (Ms/Phd to Phd) This form is for students who completed a MS degree elsewhere and have completed at least 1 semester of courses at UMass. .doc Template .pdf Template Travel Grant Application Funds may be awarded to students only if they are presenting work done at UMass at a conference or meeting. (""Presenting"" means standing at the front of the conference or meeting room and speaking to the audience; being on the author list for a paper does not by itself suffice.) Those simply attending and not presenting (even if on the author list) are not eligible to receive travel grant funds. The amount of funding varies from year to year and there is no guarantee of funding. The Program Director determines the amount of each travel grant. Decisions are sent to the student, the grant administrator for the student's faculty advisor and the CICS Accountant via email with instructions on how to receive the award.  Requests will not be processed for doctoral students without confirmation from the student's research advisor that they are aware and otherwise unable to support the travel.  It is normally expected that grant funded research has travel paid from the grant. Requests from master's students will be reviewed by the MPD only. Completed applications are to be submitted to the graduate programs assistant, Kyle Skemer, at kskemer@umass.edu before travel. Forms can be submitted electronically and must include an employee ID number (if you have one). If a travel grant is approved, the student must also receive travel authorization for any travel outside of the state or overnight.  This is done by the grants administrator of the student's faculty advisor or by the college accountant for master's students. Students arrange travel themselves and save all receipts and boarding passes for reimbursement. Students may also need a visa to travel outside the US.  Please allow extra time for visa processing. All receipts should be submitted to the research advisor's Grant Administrator for reimbursement.  Once reimbursements are processed, the funds are added to a paycheck and deposited into a bank account on file. Travel Grant Application Form Transfer Course credit Form Submit the transfer of credit form to the Graduate Programs Assistant, Kyle Skemer, at kskemer@umass.edu at any time after the start of a graduate program but not less than 60 days prior to submitting an eligibility form to graduate. 1. Please select the form that is appropriate for the transfer. If the student is transferring course credit from outside the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the form must be signed off by the Registrar at the appropriate institution prior to submitting to CICS. 2. If the student is transferring courses from the Computer Science program or other UMass Amherst program they need to contact their undergraduate program manager to save the courses PRIOR to graduation. 2. Fill in the course(s) on the form and email the completed form to Graduate Programs Assistant, Kyle Skemer, at kskemer@umass.edu for CICS to obtain approvals. 3. Please allow up to three weeks for the form to be circulated for signatures and sent to the University Registrar. UMass Amherst undergraduates may transfer a graduate course into the master's program if it was not applied to the undergraduate degree. Undergraduates must contact the Undergraduate Program Manager prior to the end of the last semester in order to request the course(s) be set aside for transfer. A UMass Amherst undergraduate may transfer such a graduate course assigned a ""Pass"" if the underlying grade is a C or better or with any letter grade of a C or better.

After the add/drop period ends, all students must submit an add/drop form signed by the instructor to the graduate school in order to drop a course. Students should send the signed form to the Graduate School at gradrec@grad.umass.edu . If you have any questions please email Kyle Skemer at kskemer@cs.umass.edu . Registration takes place online using the University's SPIRE student information system. Degree-seeking graduate students are required to maintain continuous enrollment each semester until the degree is awarded . Students receiving tuition waivers may only enroll in UNIV sections and not UWW sections. CREDIT OVERLOAD REQUEST If you would like to enroll in more than 12 credits, please make this request by sending an email to Eileen Hamel at ehamel@cs.umass.edu Masters Project AND PhD SYNTHESIS Project * Submit the appropriate form to enroll in the master's project .  After project approval from your faculty readers and the Program Director, your project will be circulated among the faculty for a period of seven days. Upon the seventh day, a staff member will enroll you in CMPSCI 701Y or 701 (701Y - 6 credits over two semesters; 701 - 6 credits over one semester). At the end of the semester(s) your two faculty readers will submit either an agreed upon grade if completed or INC if the project is not completed. * The Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences does not have a Masters Thesis option. DISSERTATION CREDITS Enrollment in dissertation credits is by permission only. During the fall and spring semesters doctoral students should request enrollment here: 899 Form . Students do not need to request more than 18 dissertation credits throughout your program. Your grade will automatically be recorded by the Graduate School as ""IP"" until you successfully defend your thesis and then it will change to SAT.

A doctoral candidate must spend the equivalent of at least one continuous academic year of full-time graduate work (nine credits per semester) in residence at the university. The residency year must be either in a Fall/Spring or Spring/Fall sequence. During this year, the student must spend some part of each week physically on campus. Waitlist Some classes will offer automated waitlists through SPIRE while others will not. If you see that a class is full, enroll yourself onto the automated waitlist if one exists (you can tell because the class will show a non-zero waitlist capacity in the SPIRE Schedule of Classes), or wait until the start of the term approaches to see if new spaces are freed. You will be assigned a position number on the waitlist, but departments and instructors may exercise their own judgment in altering students' positions on the waitlist. A position on a waitlist indicates a possibility, not a promise. You will never move from the waitlist to the class if the move would cause a time conflict in your schedule, if you are fully registered into another section of the same course, or if you are already registered for the maximum number of credits in your unit limit! If you are on a waitlist and there is a time conflict in your schedule, you may be removed from the waitlist without notice if your position number on the waitlist prevents others with no time conflicts to register. Once classes have begun, CICS is in total control of which students, if any, will be moved from a waitlist into newly-opened seats in classes. Students still seeking admission to a full class after classes start should attend the first class meeting and continue to seek admission to the class via SPIRE. More information about waitlists can be found on this webpage: Registrar Waitlist SAT grade AND AUDIT You do not need to contact the graduate programs staff about earning a SAT grade or auditing a course. This is a discussion you have with the instructor of the course. Graduate student policies are different than undergraduate Pass/Fail and audit policies. Steps you need to complete for Pass/Fail: Ask your course instructor if they will permit you to take the course for a SAT grade which is recorded as SAT (satisfactory) or F (failure) on your transcript. Your instructor is under no obligation to say yes. Your instructor may tell you it is too late in the semester for a SAT grade option. You must complete the requirements of the course. Remind your instructor at the end of the course about your agreement so the correct grade is entered in SPIRE. Your instructor is under no obligation to retract the p/f if you request it at the end of the semester. Steps you need to complete for Audit: PLEASE NOTE:  Once you've enrolled in a course as an audit, you can't change back to a letter grade. 1. Before the end of the add/drop period you can enter audit in SPIRE when you enroll in a course. If you have already enrolled in a course for a grade, and would like to change it to audit before the end of the add/drop period you will need to complete an add/drop form. 2. After the end of add/drop period fill out the late Add/Drop form which can be found on this webpage: Late Add/Drop Form 3. After the Instructor signs the form, send it to gradrec@grad.umass.edu . PENALTY FOR LATE REGISTRATION If you do not register by the last day to add classes for the semester, you will be withdrawn from the graduate program. If you wish to enroll after the deadline, you will be required to obtain readmission authorization from the graduate program office and will be required to pay the readmission fee of $150.00 in addition to any course fees or retroactive continuous enrollment/program fees. Readmission under this condition is subject to graduate program approval and is not guaranteed. Independent Study Enrollment Complete the graduate independent study form found here: Graduate Program Forms . Follow the instructions included with the form. No course enrollment Degree-seeking graduate students are required to maintain continuous enrollment each semester until the degree/certificate is awarded. If you are not enrolling in any courses during an academic semester you must enroll in Continuous Enrollment/Program Fee, GRADSCH 999 using the University's SPIRE student information system. You can find this Continuous Enrollment course in the Schedule of Classes under GRADSCH 999. The cost for Continuous Enrollment/Program Fee is $285.00 which will be billed by the Bursar's Office. Students on Continuous Enrollment are also assessed half of the Graduate Student Senate Tax. An incomplete course from a previous semester does not maintain your enrollment. First semester students are not eligible for Continuous Enrollment. All students enrolled in fewer than 5 credits must submit a registration form for health insurance to UHS. UWW Course enrollment PhD students and Bay State Fellows must enroll in the University section of every graduate course in order to obtain a tuition waiver. If a student enrolls in a UWW course section, the student will be required to pay the tuition for the UWW course.

Information Retrieval (IR) develops techniques for effective and efficient search of large archives of text.  Search engines now provide near-instant access to billions of pieces of information in multiple languages to millions of simultaneous users, retrieving and connecting web pages, video, social media, news, products, answers, scholarly articles, and many other types of information. They provide user interfaces to simplify the information-seeking ""conversation"" between user and machine.  IR research makes this possible and drives constant improvements for the future. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strives to get computers to understand human language. NLP has seen enormous progress, but current systems have a very shallow understanding of the rich subtleties in language. Our research integrates machine learning and computational linguistics to better extract knowledge and insights from text corpora, such as analysis of social media, news, scholarly articles, and computational social science applications. NLP is inherently multidisciplinary, and NLP-related research at UMass also involves our colleagues in linguistics and the social sciences.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Info_Accepted_students_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/information-newly-accepted-students,"Informatics FAQs How does the Informatics program compare to the existing BS and BA degree programs in Computer Science? The BA and BS programs in Computer Science involve considerably more ambitious technical content (and in the case of the BS, considerably more mathematics content). While the BA, the BS, and the Informatics program all begin with the same programming sequence, the Informatics program requires less computer science coursework after these first two classes. While the BA and the BS programs train students to be software developers (though many become involved in other computational activities); the Informatics program, in contrast, trains students to be effective at learning and applying computational principles (and tools) to other disciplines. How does the Informatics program compare to the campus's IT-minor program? The UMass CICS IT-minor is just that: a minor; it consists of just 5 or 6 classes. By contrast, the Informatics program is a major program, involving 18 required classes. What other classes besides those listed are required of Informatics students? As with all students at the University, Informatics students will be required to take the full suite of general education classes. Informatics students will also be required to meet all other requirements for a UMass B.S. Degree. However, Informatics students will have no foreign language requirement. What kinds of jobs are appropriate for students who graduate with an Informatics degree? There are several kinds of jobs that Informatics graduates should be qualified to fill. Graduates would have the expertise to manage multimedia databases consisting of quantities of text, datasets, and still images such as those comprising modern healthcare records, personnel files, or product design histories. Graduates would have the skills to prepare reports based on the integration of diverse datasets, charts, and maps that could then be used in studies such as those that link housing patterns to employment and educational opportunities, or those that link outbreaks of disease to underlying causes and transmission modes. Our graduates would be well-prepared to work as analysts for a variety of different industries. If I major in Informatics, will I be eligible for co-ops through the University co-op office? A co-op -- generally, a paid position at a company for 3 - 9 months -- is a great way to become acquainted with the job market in a particular field. Many of the co-ops currently offered to computer science students are also completely appropriate for Informatics students. In fact, we have already had students pursue these opportunities.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\MS_Core_Req_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/core-requirements-ms,"Core Requirements and Additional Computer Science Courses Core Courses To demonstrate your breadth of knowledge in computer science, you are required to satisfy a set of core requirements. The cores are drawn from three broad areas of Computer Science: theory, systems,and artificial intelligence. In general, you need to satisfy one or more requirements in each of the three areas. Most cores are satisfied by taking an appropriate class--indicated in parentheses below--and getting a high enough grade (B for MS). CICS course offering plan can be found here https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/course-offering-plan Note: Not all core courses are currently available online; new online courses are being added each semester. Theory cores The following courses can be used to complete the Theory core requirement. Formal Language Theory (COMPSCI 501) Logic in Computer Science (COMPSCI 513) Combinatorics (Math 513)* Algorithms for Data Science (COMPSCI 514) Combinatorics and Graph Theory (COMPSCI 575) Quantum Cryptography and Communication (COMPSCI 590AB) Quantum Information Systems (COMPSCI 590Q) Algorithmic Fairness and Strategic Behavior (COMPSCI 515) Computation theory (COMPSCI 601) Advanced Algorithms (COMPSCI 611) Logic (COMPSCI 613, or 513, but not both ) Randomized Algorithms (COMPSCI 614) Computational Geometry (COMPSCI 617) Quantum Information Systems (COMPSCI 648, or 590Q, but not both ) Optimization for Computer Science (COMPSCI 651) Approximation Algorithms (COMPSCI 690AA) Foundations Applied Cryptography (COMPSCI 690C) Advanced Cryptography (COMPSCI 690J) Machine Learning Theory (COMPSCI 690M)* Coding Theory and Applications (COMPSCI 690T) These courses may be used to complete one or two theory core requirements. Other than any co- or prerequisites, there are no restrictions on which classes may be used to satisfy theory core requirements or the order in which they must be taken.

Students who potentially could apply to the UMass PhD program should follow the MS/PhD core/course requirements. Passing out of a Core Requirement In some circumstances, it may be possible to pass or test out of a core requirement on the basis of equivalent coursework at another institution. It may also be possible to substitute a different advanced course for a core requirement. Such approval will be based on the content of that course as it compares to the content of the parallel course taught in this department. If you believe you should pass out of a core requirement, please download the Waiver of Core Requirements Form and contact the appropriate professor. The instructor will notify the Master's Program Director of his or her recommendation. If you are requesting a waiver of more than 1 core course, each professor must be aware of this and sign off on both waiver requests. The Master's Program Director will then determine whether or not to accept that recommendation. (Such recommendations are rarely declined.) Note that passing out of a core course addresses the core requirement only. In particular, it does not absolve you from taking the corresponding credit hours. If you needed to take 18 credits and you passed out of one 3-credit core course, you still need to take 18 credits.

You must have satisfied four core requirements (one from each of three areas, plus one additional requirement from any of the three areas). This requirement is usually satisfied by taking courses and getting a B or better in them. Credits . You must take a total of 30 credits with the following restrictions: No more than 18 of the course credits may come from courses at the 500 level. 500-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. No more than 6 credits may come from independent studies and/or SAT (Also known as Pass/Fail). The SAT option for graduate students is only allowed by instructor consent. No more than 9 credits may come from courses outside of the computer science department. At least 12 of those credits must come from courses at the 600-900 level that are not independent studies. 600-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. Classes with a grade below a C may not be counted toward the MS degree. Only a limited number of credits may be transferred from other programs or institutions. GPA . Your overall grade point average for the 30 credits must be 3.0 or higher. Transferring Credit If you enter the program and have already taken some courses at another institution, it may be possible to transfer some of your credits. The following Graduate School rules limit your options: You may transfer a maximum of 12 graduate credits. However, a maximum of six credits may be from any combination of the following: other accredited colleges or universities in the US non-degree credits taken at UMass courses taken as an undergraduate (that were not applied to the baccalaureate degree) Continuing Education courses Transfer credits must come from courses where you received a B or better and that were taken no more than three years prior to your entering the program. Credits from outside the University of Massachusetts Amherst may not be used to satisfy the 600-800 level requirement for a Masters degree. The grade you received on transferred credits does not apply toward the GPA requirement of the degree. Graduate courses that have been applied toward any baccalaureate or advanced degree may not be used for fulfilling requirements for any other master's degree at the University. You may not transfer credits from outside the University of Massachusetts Amherst to satisfy any requirements for the PhD. The Graduate Student Handbook provides more details. Note that transferred credit only reduces your credit requirements toward the Masters or PhD degree. It does not satisfy other requirements. In particular, transferring a course does not automatically result in your passing a corresponding core requirement. If you feel that the course should satisfy a core requirement, see the instructions on passing out of a core requirement .

Concentration in Field Experience Expanding opportunities for practical training is an essential part of training students for entry into the workforce and improving their ability to interview effectively upon graduation.  Students completing the concentration will satisfy the requirements of our existing master's program with the addition of conducting an internship, co-op, practicum, or other similar experience with a commercial company, government agency, or similar entity.  Students will gain experience in applying knowledge from their courses in ""real world"" situations. Students will apply knowledge gained in a classroom setting in an industrial, governmental, or other practical setting.  This will help students learn about the process of taking ideas from an academic setting and implementing them in a robust and maintainable fashion.  Each internship is unique, but they will all help students understand what it takes to translate ideas and algorithms into working systems. This exposes students to practical implementations of algorithms and systems from late-stage undergraduate courses and introductory MS courses.  The students will then take that implementation experience and use it for a project in a graduate-level computer science course after the field experience.  This creates a feedback loop of theory and practice. A requirement of this concentration is to complete this practical experience early on in their degree program.  This practical experience happens after at least two courses, one in systems and one in AI.  These courses provide the student with the foundational knowledge applied during the practical experience. After the practical experience, the student will apply what they learned to at least one project-based course. If you are participating in this concentration, please complete the pre-application form at the link below**. This form allows CICS staff to ensure students are on the correct path for this concentration.  You can access this form via your UMass email.

Submit a Pre-Application **FALL '23 start MS students, please DO NOT fill out the pre-application until you are physically in the US. ** 1. Required PRE-internship courses Before the practical experience, students must complete at least two introductory courses that will provide foundational knowledge for the practical experience.  Those courses must include two of our MS core courses, one from systems and one from AI, from the following list: Systems: COMPSCI 520: Theory and Practice of Software Engineering COMPSCI 532: Systems for Data Science COMPSCI 560  Introduction to Computer and Network Security COMPSCI 630: Systems COMPSCI 645: Database Design and Implementation COMPSCI 653: Advanced Computer Networking COMPSCI 660: Advanced Information Assurance COMPSCI 677: Distributed and Operating Systems COMPSCI 690AB: Systems for Deep Learning AI: COMPSCI 685: Advanced Natural Language Processing COMPSCI 603: Robotics COMPSCI 646: Information Retrieval COMPSCI 670: Computer Vision COMPSCI 589 or 689: Machine Learning COMPSCI 682: Neural Networks: Modern Intro **Additional and or alternate courses, AI and systems only, will be approved on a student by student basis, only. Students must endeavor to take the above classes before seeking special approval for an alternate class.** **Students must pass BOTH the AI and the SYSTEMS before the students can carry out their internship/CPT. If one course is passed and the other is failed students can no longer carry out their internship.** 2. INTERNSHIP Conduct an internship at an industrial company, government agency, or similar entity prior to starting the final semester of the MS CS program. The internship may be conducted during the summer after one semester or during the second or third semester, but not during the final semester. Regardless, of concentration, students CANNOT carry out full-time in their final semester. The internship will NOT EARN CREDIT TOWARDS YOUR MS DEGREE. All internships must be approved by the college. If the internship is during the semester, students will need to pay for the 1-credit CPT course at the semesterly tuition rate . If the internship is during the summer and or winter, the CPT course is billed at the summer rate 3. Post-internship Project-based course After the field experience, students must take at least one course, that has been approved by the graduate programs team, that has a major project component. Independent study ( CompSci 696 or CompSci 696DS or CompSci 696E ) and Master's project ( CompSci 701 ) will automatically qualify.  Any other course that has a major project component involving implementation will also qualify.  Students should consult with instructors to find out if a major project component exists in the course and the department will maintain a list of courses that typically do.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\MS_PHD_Other_Program_Info_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/other-program-information,"MS/PhD Program Information This page contains additional graduate program information about Academic Advisors , Assistantships , TA and RA assignments , Internships , Statute of Limitations , Leave of Absences and Withdrawals . Academic Advisor You will be assigned an academic advisor when you enter the Computer Science doctoral program. Generally, if you work as an RA for a professor, he or she will be your advisor. If you are a TA, your advisor will be a professor with whom you share research interests. You should meet with your advisor at least once a semester (typically, more often) to review the previous semester in terms of goals, problems, progress, and so on; and to set new goals for the coming semester. You may request a different academic advisor at any point. Similarly, your advisor might suggest that you should be assigned a different advisor. These requests should be made to the Graduate Program Director. Assistantships Our doctoral students are guaranteed funding on an assistantship for the first five years of their program as long as they are making adequate academic progress. Assistantships are either Research Assistantships (RAs) or Teaching Assistantships (TAs). Departmental assistantships awarded to entering PhD candidates are for the first twelve months and after that are guaranteed during the two academic semesters. In general, the major support for PhD candidates is expected to come from RAs on faculty research grants and contracts. Assistantship Contracts The terms of an assistantship contract are governed by the graduate student union (Graduate Employee Organization, or GEO) and are therefore out of our control. The following represents our informal understanding of the current rules, combined with typical practices within the Department. The GEO contract, however, is the final authority on these issues, not these pages. The contract is available from the GEO web site . The normal workload of an RA consists of 20 hours during the academic year. The responsibilities of an RA are determined by the faculty member responsible for the research, but could include tasks such as programming, running experiments, carrying out literature surveys, and so on. For most students in our department, the distinction between being an RA and being a ""graduate student doing your own research"" is difficult to make, meaning that deciding whether you're working more than 20 hours is complex. If your RAship requires more than 20 hours on average and is detracting from a reasonable course load, you should talk with your research supervisor. If you are working fewer than 20 hours on average for your RAship, you should also talk with your advisor. A TA is also expected to put in 20 hours per week on average. The responsibilities of a TA include preparing assignments, grading, running discussion sections, holding office hours, or delivering lectures. The actual responsibilities of a TA are directed by the faculty member teaching the assigned course. It is easier to separate a teaching assistantship from your own research or coursework, so you should know whether you are putting too much (or too little) time into a TA. Keep in mind that (1) TA work is not evenly distributed through the semester and (2) although the course itself meets for only about 14 weeks, the TAship runs a full 19 weeks. The official rules for time off include vacation time, holidays, and personal time: The University honors 13 paid holidays a year. You officially earn 2 hours of vacation time per month, or roughly one day per semester. You get 24 hours of personal time per semester, or roughly another three days per semester. Vacation time and, when possible, personal time should be requested in advance and should preferably be taken in the January or Spring breaks. Alternate arrangements can be made with your advisor or TA supervisor if possible. For example, many RAs and their advisors are comfortable with a much less formal way of handling time off. If you feel that you are not getting sufficient vacation or personal time, you should talk with your advisor, supervisor, or the Graduate Program Director. Changing Between TA and RA The department sets a fixed number of TA positions each semester. We attempt to provide a TAship for every student who needs one, either because there is no appropriate RA or to satisfy the PhD teaching requirement. TA assignments usually happen in July for the fall semester and November for the spring. If you accept a TA offer, you cannot withdraw and become an RA once the semester has started. In fact, you may not unilaterally withdraw from a TAship even before the semester starts. Why not? Assigning TAs is a complex process of matching student abilities with teaching needs. Last minutes changes can create cascading changes and almost always result in an incredible amount of work by many people.) If you find that you want to switch out of your TAship into an RA offer, you should contact the Teaching Coordinator, Emma Anderson. If it is possible to accommodate your request, they will do so. However, the closer to the start of the semester, the less likely it is that the request can be met. The official rules pertaining to TAs who want to switch to being RAs are: ""After June 30 or December 30 of each year, students who have accepted a TA offer for the Fall or Spring semester, respectively, may not withdraw from the appointment without the permission of the Graduate Program Director and the Chairperson. After August 20 or January 15, permission will not be granted.'' In practice, there's always a little shuffling in the first week of term, and you're most likely to get what you want if you notify the Emma Anderson early. Internships Many students take an internship, usually in the summer but occasionally during the spring or fall semesters. An internship provides experience with a different group of researchers working on different problems. It can provide valuable networking as well as as practical training. Internship opportunities are advertised regularly by email and/or the sponsoring organization's web site. It is your responsibility to find possible internships if you are interested in one. (Most advisors are happy to help.) For US citizens and permanent residents of the US, the process of taking an internship is straightforward. If you hold a student visa, you will need approval to undertake an internship. The internship is treated as Curricular Practical Training and must be approved by the International Programs Office. Your specific limitations and requirements will depend on your visa. Check with the IPO for more information. Statute of Limitations When you are admitted to the MS, MS/PhD, or PhD program, the Graduate School assigns you a statute of limitations date. This date reflects the amount of time the Graduate School believes you need to complete your degree. It is initially three years for MS-only, six for the MS/PhD track, and four years for PhD-only. If you take an approved leave of absence, your statue of limitations is automatically extended by the length of the leave. If your progress toward your delay is taking longer than the Graduate School's initial estimate, it is possible to extend your statute of limitations. However, you cannot do that yourself. Instead, your advisor and the Graduate Program Director send a request to the Graduate School asking that the date be extended and explaining why the request is reasonable. The Graduate School frowns on more than two requests for an extension, however they are usually granted: your advisor is unlikely to request an extension if there is not a compelling reason. If your statute of limitations expires, you are formally terminated from the program. It is possible to petition to be re-admitted though there are costs associated with doing so. Do not let your statute of limitations expire. The Department tracks your statue of limitations and works hard to ensure it does not expire accidentally, but the ultimate responsibility is yours. Leave of Absence Some students need to take a leave from the program for personal or professional reasons. If you wish or need to take a leave of absence, discuss the situation with your advisor who will ask the Graduate Program Director to request the leave from the Graduate School. The request will need a reason for the leave as well as its anticipated duration. Leaves of one semester or one full year are the most common. (If the reason for your leave cannot be comfortably discussed with your advisor, you should talk with the Graduate Program Director directly.) For MS/PhD and PhD students, the Department discourages leaves of absence the semester that the portfolio is to be submitted. There are occasionally compelling reasons for a leave then, but a leave should not be used merely to delay the portfolio. While you are on a leave of absence, you will be required to pay the University a continuous enrollment fee each semester to maintain your enrollment. Withdrawing from the Program Although we hope it does not happen, some students end up withdrawing from the program. The most common such situation is when a student in the MS/PhD track decides that PhD-style research is not a good match for his or her interests. However, some students end up withdrawing for other reasons and at other times. If you need to change your degree program or withdraw from the program entirely, please contact the Graduate Program Director to discuss your situation. Note that in some cases it may make more sense to take a leave of absence than to withdraw from the program.

Degree (before or after portfolio submission) Pass the College of Information and Computer Sciences Qualifying Exam- Portfolio Form a Committee Propose a Thesis Complete 18 Dissertation Credits & 1 600-level course & 1 elective course Pass the Teaching Assistant Requirement Pass the Residency Requirement at least 9 credits, each semester, in back-to-back semesters which is usually satisfied with the dissertation credits Defend and Submit a Thesis Sample schedule (MS/PhD) The following schedule shows one way in which an MS/PhD student could progress through the program to complete both the MS and PhD in five years (most students who complete in five years actually complete in the summer after their 10th semester). Because people have different backgrounds and different skills, your progress will almost certainly vary somewhat from this. It can be a helpful guide nonetheless. Students supported by an RAship will be able to make progress more efficiently if their Masters and Synthesis projects as well as their dissertation are well aligned with the RAship.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\MS_Requirements_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/grads/ms-requirements,"Master's in Computer Science Program The college offers concentrations in Data Science , Security , and Field Experience which meet all of the regular non-thesis master's degree requirements. The requirements for the Concentrations in Data Science and Security emphasize data science and security related courses. The Field Experience emphasizes internship skill development applied to project based courses. All master's program students are expected to have a solid undergraduate background in computer science. If you are unsure of your background, you should consult master's advisor, Elizabeth Parolski , for course options. MS Course Requirements are explained in greater detail here . Master's students are required to: Complete 30-course credits meeting the Course Requirements Satisfy 4 Core Requirements (at least one from each area) Take one Theory, one Systems, one Machine Learning, and one from any area, and earn a B or higher in each core class. Satisfy 12 credits, or 4 courses, of 600-level or higher courses. The Master's in Computer Science degree is a non-thesis degree, however, students interested in research are encouraged to participate in independent study research after their first semester of coursework. In addition, the MS program offers a Master's Project 6 credit research opportunity. This is a project that involves working with two professors on a research project or paper. The Master's Project frequently spans two academic semesters. There is a great deal of information about the MS on the MS Advising page as well. Sample Schedule Our MS degree in Amherst usually takes two years (four semesters) to complete. We recommend the following distribution of courses for the four semesters: Year Fall Spring Summer 1st 500 CS level course 500 CS level course 500 OR 600 level course NOTE: If you have been in industry for a year or more or were not a computer science major, consider taking a Math or Statistics course to help refresh your math skill. *International students must be registered for 9 credits to fulfill full-time visa requirements *Many domestic students will take two classes each semester, as they are not required to meet a specific credit threshold. 500 level course 600-level course 500 OR 600 level course Internship (optional) *CPT approval requires students to be enrolled in two consecutive semesters before applying; an exception is only for field experience concentration. 2nd 500 level course 600-level course 500 OR 600 level course 600-level course *International students are permitted one final semester of less than 9 credits Your background and the available course offerings may cause you to shift from this model.  Each student is unique and different and each schedule will look very different. This list is intended only as a guide. We strongly recommend that students take no more than three graduate-level classes in any semester .  Additionally, students starting their MS are encouraged to take ONLY ONE 600-level class, in their first semester . International Students International students should consider a Curricular Practical Training during the first summer following the completion of two academic semesters. See the CICS CPT Process . campus Employment Effective with the cohort entering in Fall 2016, students in terminal master's programs in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences are ineligible for assistantships in the college or elsewhere on campus. Exceptions can be granted only if supported by the Chair of the Faculty and approved by the Dean of the College, in extraordinary circumstances needed to meet instructional or research needs. All MS students are eligible to apply for 15-week grader appointments after their first semester. Campus graduate hourly positions are also available, these are positions where students receive a paycheck for hours worked.

Concentration in Security Revised July 19, 2021 M.S. Computer Science Core 12 credits Security Concentration Requirements: Security Electives 6 credits Electives 12 credits Total Credits 30 credits Requirements of the MS in Computer Science with a Security Concentration 10 courses (30 credits) MS Computer Science Core Requirements Four courses (12 credits) Students must satisfy the CompSci MS core requirements : four courses (12 credits) of the 30 credits including at least one course from Systems, Theory, and AI areas (see table below). Systems Core Requirement: Either COMPSCI 660 or COMPSCI 560 (597N) must be taken as a Systems Core for this Security concentration. Students may petition to the Master's Program Director to substitute this requirement with a class roughly equivalent to either and that the equivalent of receiving a ""B grade or higher"" was awarded. (Students should not expect the credits to necessarily transfer to the MS degree.) Courses from the MS COMPSCI Systems Core menu or the Security Systems Core menu count as a second Systems core for this concentration only. Security Systems Core menu: This table is an example. The tables are maintained by the Master's Program Director according to current/regular course offerings. COMPSCI 660 Advanced Information Assurance COMPSCI 560 Introduction to Computer and Network Security (formerly COMPSCI 597N) COMPSCI 690B Detecting Interference in Networks COMPSCI 565 Advanced Digital Forensics (formerly COMPSCI 590K) COMPSCI 661 Secure Distributed Systems COMPSCI 561 System Defense and Test (formerly COMPSCI 590A) COMPSCI 564 Cyber Effects: Reverse Engineering, Exploit Analysis, and Capability Development (formerly COMPSCI 590J COMPSCI 690C Foundations of Applied Cryptography A grade of ""B"" or better is required for core classes. 500-level courses do not count toward MS/PhD core requirements. Students who potentially could apply to the UMass PhD program should follow the MS/PhD core/course requirements. 12 credits Security Electives Requirements Two courses (6 credits) Students must take two security electives from Security Systems Electives menu .

Math 571 and ECE 597XX may not be used towards the MS degree (since they overlap with COMPSCI 690C Foundations of Applied Cryptography). A grade of ""B"" or better is required for these classes. 6 credits Electives Requirements Four courses (12 credits) Students must take four additional COMPSCI courses as free electives. These courses are not limited to security courses. 12 credits Total 30 credits Course Requirements: No more than 9 credits may come from courses outside of CICS. Credit for graduate courses from other departments must be approved by the GPD. No more than 18 of the course credits may come from courses at the 500 level. 500-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. At least 12 of those 18 credits must come from courses at the 600-900 level that are not independent studies. 600-level classes taken to satisfy core requirements fall into this group. No more than 6 credits may be pass/fail. At most 12 credits from independent studies and/or a Master's project (COMPSCI 701). Classes with a grade below a C may not be counted toward the MS degree. No more than 12 credits may be transferred from other programs or institutions. Your overall grade point average for those 30 MS credits must be 3.0 or higher.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Our_History_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/history-school-computer-science,"Our History The Early Days The '90s and '00s Leadership Computing came to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the early 1960s, as a result of the needs of the Chemistry Department. What had started as a departmental operation became formalized as the Research Computing Center (RCC), under the Directorship of Robert Rowell, and with crucial guidance from the Computer Committee, chaired by Richard Stein of Chemistry. In addition to the computing services a center could provide, it was necessary to establish an academic program to provide students with a deeper knowledge of the computer than basic programming. In 1963 the Computer Committee recommended to the Dean of the Graduate School (then Edward C. Moore) that a search for a Program Head be undertaken. As a result of that search, J.A.N. Lee was appointed Program Head in September of 1964. He was also asked to direct the RCC and to undertake the selection and installation of a new computer system. In 1964, there were four faculty: J.A.N. Lee (CS), John Goda, Sidney Rubenstein (joint appointment with RCC), and Fred Stockton (Dept. of Civil Engineering). Susan Stidham joined in 1966. “The CS program at UMass Amherst was one of the first separated programs in the United States” Lee continues, “at that time, programming was being taught in classes in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Civil Engineering at UMass Amherst primarily as graduate courses. The prime mover for creating a unified institute was Moore, with the support of those departments.” In June 1965, the Board of Trustees approved an M.S. program in Computer Science (after receiving unanimous approval by the campus Curriculum Committee in May). In September of 1965, the Program moved to new quarters and admitted its first graduate student. Lee stepped down as Director of the RCC, so that he could focus on program development. Caxton C. Foster joined the program and became Director of the RCC. At this stage, the Program and the Center became formally distinct entities within the Graduate School despite the joint appointments. “Besides trying to coordinate the various departmental courses to maintain some level of achievement, the primary tasks of the group were to develop new courses that would allow for fulfilling the requirements for the M.S. degree that had been approved,” notes Lee. “The first two approved courses were Numerical Analysis and Compilers."" ""There was no lack of candidates for the M.S. program, and many students supplemented their undergraduate curriculum with CS courses, though at that time it was not an approved minor.” Conrad Wogrin was recruited from Yale to become the Director of the renamed University Computing Center (UCC), succeeding Foster in 1967, and also held a professorship in the Program. In 1967, James Bouhana became the first M.S. graduate. A major factor in putting the University of Massachusetts on the map in the computer world was the development, under Foster’s guidance, of a timesharing system acronymically known as UMASS (Unlimited Machine Access from Scattered Sites). Along with Foster, David Stemple and Bob Hambleton were instrumental in getting the first timesharing system operational in 1967. With the increasing demands on RCC computer time, however, it became clear that the students could not get sufficient “hands-on” experience using the RCC machines. To this end, a Computer Science Laboratory was established in 1968, as a facility run jointly with the Computer Systems Engineering faculty in the Department of Electrical Engineering. The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system. In November 1969, Lee stepped down as Head of the M.S. Program, having directed the creation of a first-rate, highly practical, industry-oriented M.S. Program in Computer Science. “Those first five years did set the base for a developing activity which eventually led to departmental status and new degree programs,” says Lee. “Our reputation in the industry and academia was excellent.” The time seemed ripe to push for approval of a Ph.D. Program, but the first proposal failed to gain approval because of an insufficient emphasis on doctoral level research. Wogrin assumed the Acting Headship, and the responsibility for the search for a new Chair to oversee a successful second try. He recruited Michael Arbib from Stanford, where Arbib was then an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering. Arbib became Chair of the Program in September 1970. He met with all faculty members interested in computer science across campus to chart their interests. Then, he structured the Ph.D. proposal around three themes: Systems (building on the strengths of Lee and Foster), Theory of Computation, and Cybernetics (Brain Theory and Artificial Intelligence). With the help of Mort Appley, Dean of the Graduate School, and Wogrin, the proposal moved up through the UMass administration in Amherst before going to the UMass Board of Trustees in Boston, where Councilor Troy proved a strong supporter. The Ph.D. proposal was approved in January of 1972 along with an upgrading from an M.S. Program in Computer Science in the Graduate School to a Department of  Computer and Information Science (COINS) offering both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. In 1972, there were nine COINS faculty:  Michael Arbib, Richard Eckhouse, Caxton Foster, William Kilmer, J.A.N. Lee, Edward Riseman, Susan.N. Stidham, Robert Taylor, and Conrad Wogrin. Grant activity in FY73 was $169,588. A letter to grad students described the housing costs in 1972: “Generally, apartments are very expensive — $150 for a one bedroom apartment is a typical price.” In an article celebrating the program’s 25th anniversary, Wogrin noted, “We had an identity even back in our early years. When the ACM was celebrating their 25th anniversary in the early 70s, Cax Foster and Michael Arbib had articles in the anniversary issue of the ACM Communications journal. This was a strong showing as there were only a very select group of invited articles.” In 1972, the University opened the (Lederle) Graduate Research Center, and the new Department became an anchor tenant of the low rise building, along with the Graduate School, the Science Library, and the University Computing Center. The Department graduated its first Ph.D. student, Suad Alagic, in February of 1974. In 1978, the undergraduate major in COINS was established under the leadership of Robert M. Graham, who succeeded Arbib as Chair in September of 1975. The department developed not only as a center of excellence in computer science (“one of the 20 departments in the top 10,” as Arbib put it) but also as a nexus for interdisciplinary research, with a Center for Systems Neuroscience, the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics, and the Cognitive Science Program. In addition, it started to grow expertise in computer systems, adding faculty in networking, distributed systems, databases, information retrieval, and software engineering, and in theory, adding faculty in complexity theory and algorithms. By 1980, there were 90 graduate students, 80 undergraduates, 12 faculty, and a Research Computing Facility based on Digital Equipment Corporation’s VAX 11/780. Enrollment in COINS courses was 2180 in FY80 and grant income was $665,608. Under the leadership of Edward Riseman (Chair from 1981-1985), the Department had phenomenal growth during the 1980s. Riseman’s strategy for recruiting new faculty whose research overlapped with the research of others in the Department had tremendous bearing on the success and camaraderie that CS enjoys today. Wogrin became Acting Chair in 1985 until Rick Adrion was recruited in 1986 to become the next COINS Chair, a position that he held until 1994. Highlights of 1990s and 2000s In 1990, COINS, in collaboration with the computer science departments of all the State colleges and universities, formed the Massachusetts Computer Science Education Consortium (MCSEC) to improve computer science education throughout the Commonwealth. Also in 1990, the first Issue of the Department’s newsletter, Loose Change, was published. In 1991-1992, over $23 million in federal/state/industry support was secured for a number of programs:  the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR), the Center for Autonomous, Real-Time Systems (CARTS), Project Pilgrim, and a DoD/URI Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence. Each of these projects was initially under the umbrella of the Center for Real-Time and Intelligent Complex Computing Systems (CRICCS), which began with an NSF/CII grant in 1991. The Computer and Information Science Department changed its name to the Department of Computer Science in March 1992. In 1997, the Sidney Topol Distinguished Lecturer Series was started, and the following year, the Department initiated the Bay State Fellows program. In Fall 1999, the Department of Computer Science moved to its current home, the Computer Science Research Center, located at 140 Governors Drive. At the time of the move, the Department had 37 faculty (tenure track plus research), 164 graduate students, 403 undergraduates, and 97 technical and administrative staff. Grant activity was $13 million in FY2000. In 2000, the Board of Higher Education funded the Commonwealth Information Technology Initiative (CITI) with UMass Amherst in the lead. CITI works to improve IT education across MA public higher education and promote “IT across the curriculum.” That same year, The UMass IT Program was established with the IT minor as its major education program. The Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science became an official program in Fall 2010. In Fall 2012, the Department of Computer Science became the School of Computer Science, signaling the recognition by the campus both of the excellence of the computer science faculty as well as the increasingly central role that computer science plays within UMass, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the nation. On April 8, 2015, the UMass Board of Trustees approved the change from the School of Computer Science to the College of Information and Computer Sciences.

Take the CICS Pledge Against Racism: Over 2020–2021, we invited every member of our community to take a pledge committing to two antiracist actions—such as educating ourselves about systemic racism, serving on a committee for racial equity at CICS, or participating in direct actions against racism. NCWIT Extension Services Undergraduate Programs Grant: CICS is in its second year of working with a consultant through the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT) Extension Services grant to develop a strategic foundation for increasing women’s participation in our undergraduate program. We are focused on making systemic changes to our strategies for recruitment and retention. NCWIT Extension Services Grad Grant: CICS is proud to be the pilot institution for the NCWIT Extension Services Grad grant program. We are working with a small team of consultants to improve all students’ experience in our PhD program, from application to graduation. HackHer413: With financial and staff support from the college, students established HackHer413 , a hackathon for women and non-binary students. In its first year, HackHer413 brought 300 students to the UMass Amherst campus from all over the United States! Massenberg Summer Institute: A two-week in-person STEM experience focused on uplifting talented rising 10th graders of color and/or economic disadvantage, supported by the Samuel E. Massenberg Sr. Foundation. Undergraduate Mentorship Program: As a part of our work with NCWIT, the CICS Diversity Committee launched an undergraduate mentorship program that pairs junior and senior students with first-year students for social support. Ongoing Programs & Initiatives The College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) offers a number of ongoing programs and events designed to increase participation in computing and foster a welcoming and inclusive environment. CICS Community Discussions: We host a series of facilitated discussions about life and the different intersectionalities we all have. Our discussions are open to the campus community and bring us all together to learn, talk, and engage. These are opportunities for community members to develop their ability to have difficult, respectful, substantial discussions about many of the identities that separate us from each other. Student Organizations in Computer Science (SOCS) : CICS has many student-led organizations that enrich our college and provide opportunities to explore and learn. The annual SOCS celebration, typically held in the spring, is an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the leaders of these organizations in a festive environment. Travel Funding for Conferences: CICS provides travel funding for students to attend various conferences related to diversity in computing, including Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing, WeCode, CRA-W Grad Cohort Workshop, and CRA Grad Cohort Workshop for Underrepresented Minorities and Persons with Disabilities. Rising Stars in CS: The college's Rising Stars in Computer Science lecture series highlights the stellar work of young female computer scientists about to launch into careers in academia. Northampton Pride March: Our college's faculty, staff, students, and family members march in the Northhampton Pride Parade. This annual event brings our community together to support LGBTQIA+ members of our community. Women in Engineering and Computing Career Day: We collaborate with the UMass Amherst College of Engineering to bring young women from high schools all around Massachusetts to campus for a day. Participants hear keynote speakers, talk with industry professionals, and participate in workshops on engineering and computing topics. CRA Data Buddies: In an effort to improve computer science programs across the nation, CICS provides climate and outcome data to the Computer Research Association's Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) Data Buddies program.

According to the U.S. News & World Report rankings of the best graduate schools, the UMass Amherst graduate program in computer science in the top 25 graduate programs, while our artificial intelligence specialty ranked 15th . Our programs frequently rank even higher in metrics-based rankings such as CS Rankings , a website developed by CICS Professor Emery Berger. The graduate student body consists of over 700 graduate students from many different backgrounds and from all parts of the globe. As a group, they are characterized by a spirit of cooperation and camaraderie that contributes significantly to the college. Once students enter graduate studies, the college aims to see that they not only successfully complete a comprehensive academic program but also prepare themselves well for their future careers. Master's degree students are able to strengthen their research skills through independent studies. PhD track students are involved in research from the start of their graduate careers. Upon graduation, our students have consistently found positions in some of the best academic and industrial settings. Programs The Computer Science graduate program has three tracks: PhD, MS/PhD, and MS.  The two PhD tracks focus on research toward a PhD as well as a broad background in the field.  The MS track serves students interested in expanding their undergraduate education in computer science, either in preparation for a job where a master's degree is important, or as a first step toward a PhD here or elsewhere. How do you decide which track is the right one for you? The PhD track is for students who have already obtained a master's degree in computer science from an established and reputable US program.  These students are well prepared for PhD research and typically complete our breadth requirements quickly.  PhD students hold research or teaching assistantships which provide a tuition waiver. The combined MS/PhD track is for students who have not completed a Master of Computer Science.  These students satisfy the MS requirements--so earn a master's degree--on their way to being admitted to PhD candidacy.  The credit hour requirements for this track result in the equivalent of two courses more than in the PhD-only track.  MS/PhD students hold research or teaching assistantships which provide a tuition waiver.A number of students who are not accepted to the MS/PhD program will be offered admission to the MS program. The MS track provides a terminal non-thesis master's degree.  The program requires 30 credit hours, typically taken over two years.  Research opportunities are offered through independent studies for course credit. Some students discover an interest in computer science research and apply to the MS/PhD track during their MS program.  However, the PhD program is very selective and only a small percentage of MS students are accepted. Admission Admission is very competitive. We typically accept 10% of students applying to our PhD program and 15-20% of students applying to our MS program. Applicants come from varying backgrounds including engineering, math, computer science, electrical engineering, psychology and social sciences. Students are expected to be prepared for graduate level computer science coursework. Please see the suggested undergraduate preparation coursework. Applicants to the MS Amherst program may be invited to join through our MS Online to Amherst program if they are not admitted to the MS Amherst program. These pages are provided to help answer the questions that prospective graduate students often ask about our college, graduate programs of study, and the graduate admissions process. Applicants are also encouraged to learn more about our research , and the many benefits of living in the Amherst Area.  To apply, see our application instructions .

To interact naturally with computers, we must have computers that can relate to their environment through visual and physical interactions, from recognizing the face of an approaching person to learning about dynamics by bouncing a ball. In robotics, our expertise ranges from sophisticated grasping techniques and novel motion planning methods to complex tool use and experimenting with new types of dynamically stable robots. In computer vision, our strengths include scene modeling, face identification, object recognition, and reading the text of signs in complex outdoor environments. Our graphics group focuses on high-speed realistic rendering techniques, intelligent 3D content creation techniques, processing 3D geometric data, and visualizing complex lighting effects. A major cross-cutting interest is the desire to model basic learning processes in humans and machines using data acquired from sensors mounted on robots and mobile video cameras. By adapting our computers' strategies of grasping, reaching, moving, and recognizing to real world data rather than to synthetic laboratory data, we are building systems robust enough to operate in realistic scenarios.

This encompasses research that ranges from the low-level hardware architecture, to compiler and runtime support systems, up to software development environments and advanced tools for reasoning about system behavior, as well as the interaction among these areas. Our research methodology typically involves the development of theoretical foundations evaluated through system development and experimentation. Current projects in computer science include the formal analysis of computing systems with the goal of discovering how to use them more efficiently, process language support for human-computer interaction, automated analysis of software including model checking and static analysis, formal and practical foundations for integration and interoperability, approaches for developing robust, high-performance software systems that behave well under load or attack, and synergistic co-development of architectural performance enhancements together with compiler and run-time system optimizations.

Members of this research group have made fundamental contributions to the understanding of computational complexity. They seek to further understand the tradeoffs between certain computational resources including parallel time versus amount of computational hardware, sequential time versus reliability, and memory space versus throughput.  The members also apply theoretical tools to efficiently solve real technological problems, including how to deliver content efficiently and cost-effectively on the Internet, how to automatically check that software is meeting certain efficiency and correctness requirements, how to schedule computations efficiently in modern computing environments (e.g., clusters of workstations or computational grids), and how to coordinate ensembles of simple robots to cooperate in the performance of complex tasks.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Transfer_Course_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/admissions/course-equivalencies,"Transfer Course Equivalencies Transfer Equivalencies Excel Doc (updated 10/19/2023) Please note that transfer Grades of C- are not accepted for some CS Program Requirements. Effective July 2018, TCE Review VALID FOR 2 YEARS. The date reviewed indicates when the course was last reviewed for approval.  At present, the posted equivalency is valid for 2 years through the end of the semester year noted.  Prior to July 2018, coursework was reviewed yearly. Please use this list as a guide rather than a guarantee that the course will be accepted by Computer Science or UMass.  Also note that the reviews in the linked file are not definitive.  If you can find additional courses (either core courses or electives) at these schools or any other schools, you will need to submit the Transfer Credit Evaluation (TCE) form. Courses will be vetted by faculty who have taught the UMass COMPSCI equivalent (within the past two semesters) as part of the TCE process. We will consider each proposal on a case-by-case basis. Using the Transfer Course Equivalency Forms We are working on a new process to streamline transfer equivalency reviews and will post updates once in place. TCE Paperwork (required for mapping or review of coursework taken elsewhere): Use the Transfer Credit Evaluation (TCE) form to validate courses taken outside of UMass Amherst (instructions on the form). This is a pre-cursor to the following University paperwork for students who are already here at UMass and want to take courses elsewhere. University forms are submitted after department approval is given using the TCE form: Prior Approval for Transfer Course Work form (PAF) - to take courses elsewhere and transfer coursework back to UMass. Senior Year in Absentia (SYIA) - to finish degree requirements elsewhere and transfer coursework back to earn degree. International Course Approval form (ICAF) - to take courses on international exchange and transfer coursework back to UMass. Domestic Exchange - to take courses on domestic exchange and transfer coursework back to UMass. The TCE form is also used to review the transfer course equivalency (TR EQ) of a posted course that is granted generic CS credit upon admission, i.e., COMPSCI 1TRA, COMPSCI 1TRB, etc., or for review of Five College courses (5C EQ).  Only the TCE form is needed for these. TCE Paperwork (required for mapping or review of coursework taken elsewhere): For courses with VALID approval, submit page 1 of the TCE form only. For courses with EXPIRED semester, submit complete TCE form (both page 1 and 2). For courses not listed, submit complete TCE form (both page 1 and 2). ALL PREREQUISITES are to be completed before taking course equivalencies elsewhere.  Approval for individual students will not be granted if prerequisites are not met, e.g., you want to take a COMPSCI 377 equivalent elsewhere, but you have not satisfied the prerequisite (COMPSCI 230 with a grade of 'C' or better).  In this case, your TCE for 377 will not be approved.  Prerequisites in progress may be considered, however, final approval will not be given until the grade is posted. Registration and equivalent prerequisites: If you believe that any of your generic transfer credit should be accepted as a particular COMPSCI course, you are expected to begin the evaluation process immediately after admission so that the TCE process is completed prior to your advising/registration session, if possible. If your course(s) is still pending prior to your advising session, you should only consider taking courses that are not contingent upon your TCE, i.e., if you think you have a transfer course equivalent for COMPSCI 250 still pending a decision, do not attempt to enroll in COMPSCI 311 which has 250 as a prerequisite.  Select another course. Transfer Equivalency posting to transcript: Transfer students with coursework completed upon admission must meet the prerequisite before approved transfer equivalencies are posted to the transcript.  This may be accomplished by taking the prerequisite course(s) at UMass Amherst.  Students must email tce [at] cs.umass.edu upon completion of the prerequisites. Pre-approval for coursework (PAF/ICAF/SYIA) taken elsewhere is not granted if the prerequisite course(s) are not satisfied.  In-progress prerequisites will be considered, however, final approval will not be given until grades post. Residency Requirement The College of Information and Computer Sciences has a Residency Requirement with a limit on the number of transfer courses that will be accepted to fulfill upper level CS courses (300+) toward major requirements, as follows: BS: no more than three transfer courses are allowed (5 of the 8 CS 300+ must be taken here @UMass Amherst) BA: no more than two transfer courses are allowed (3 of the 5 CS 300+ must be taken here @UMass Amherst) There is also a limit of one Five College course to fulfill upper level CS courses for either the BS/BA and this course is counted toward courses taken outside of UMass.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Transfer_Students_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/transfer-students,"Transfer Students Transfer students interested in Computer Sciences should apply directly to the University through the Undergraduate Admissions Office . Transfer students admitted to the University but not directly to the computer science major may apply to the CS Major using the application procedure as described on our web pages. Guidelines for evaluating work taken elsewhere Some students entering the University will have already done work that can be applied to computer science requirements. Advanced experience in high school or at another college or university might make you eligible to waive some introductory course(s). Exemption from university general education requirements can only be granted by the Undergraduate Admissions/Registrar's Office. Exemption from courses in other departments required by computer science is generally granted at the discretion of the other department involved. Students who wish to start with a more advanced calculus course (MATH 132 or MATH 233) must follow the Math Department's procedures for receiving credit or exemption for Calculus I (MATH 131). Contact the Math Department for specific details. The College of Information and Computer Sciences will accept these credits/exemption as the equivalent of the required math courses. Similarly, students given credit for a Lab science course which is deemed to be equivalent to one of the required Lab science courses will be viewed as having met that CS Lab science requirement.  The relevent department will authorize the Registrar's Office to document the equivalency on the transcript. The most common exemption is for introductory programming. The first course in the introductory programming sequence is CICS 110: Foundations of Programming. This course in intended for students with little to no prior programming experience. Students receive course placement into CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming , if:  they have an Advanced Placement score of 4 or 5 on the Computer Science A exam, or by transferring equivalent coursework from other institutions using the Transfer Credit Evaluation ( TCE ) process.  In all cases, a student placed above CICS 110 should consult with the Chief Undergraduate Advisor (cua@cs.umass.edu) for questions. Credit for Equivalent CS Courses at Other Schools Matriculated transfer students will have their records evaluated by the admissions office for the initial transfer credit evaluation.  Accepted transfer credit may be verified by the Undergraduate Program Director through the Transfer Credit Evaluation ( TCE ) process to determine which courses fulfill CS requirements.  The College of Information and Computer Sciences has a Residency Requirement that requires a specific number of upper-level (300+) courses to be taken at UMass Amherst. This varies between the BS and the BA degrees. As a guide, we provide a listing of course equivalencies between UMass Amherst and other colleges in Massachusetts and the surrounding area. We believe this information is accurate, but must be verified using the TCE process on a case-by-case basis. Incoming matriculated transfer students should complete the Transfer Credit Evaluation (TCE) form as soon as possible so that equivalencies may be determined before Advising/Registration for their first semester here at UMass.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Ugrad_Research_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/ugrad-education/research-opportunities,"Research Opportunities for CICS Undergraduate Students in Computer Science and Informatics If you are excited about the possibility of gaining new understanding or knowledge and communicating those findings to others, you may be a good fit for undergraduate research opportunities at UMass Amherst College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS). These opportunities are a great way to experience research firsthand while making connections with people at CICS who share your interests in discovery. Together with mentors who are PhD students or faculty members, you will connect computing to a range of societal and scientific problems, gain skills, and open the door to careers that involve research. Some of the possible avenues for pursuing research as a CICS undergraduate are listed below, including 1) CICS-offered opportunities and 2) national opportunities that our students might want to explore. On this page: Preparing for PhD Applications and Research Careers CICS-Based Research Opportunities for Undergraduates National Research Opportunities for CICS Undergraduates Additional Information Preparing for PhD Applications and Research Careers Research experience is helpful for gaining admission into PhD programs, which are primarily about research. Working with faculty on a research project will lead to more informative letters of recommendation, demonstrating unique experience and achievement that is highly valued for academic programs and positions, and even many jobs in industry. Some research opportunities are advertised through CICS Careers or as candidate honors projects, but there are many opportunities to get involved that you will find by approaching a faculty member. If there is a faculty member or research group at CICS working in an area that interests you, start building a relationship with them by taking a class, attending research group meetings, or making an appointment to discuss research. You should also try talking to PhD students, who often help mentor undergraduates. Usually, students have completed the required 200-level CS courses before starting research, but some positions may be available earlier. Not sure how to approach someone about this? See these networking tips from CICS Careers. You can do it! CICS-based Research Opportunities for Undergraduates CICS is recognized for its excellence in faculty-led research . There are several ways for undergraduates to get involved with research projects, including introductory research programs and research experiences with faculty. Moreover, it is possible to receive course credit for research (e.g., for an independent study or honors project) or even receive a stipend. ERSP: Early Research Scholars Program ERSP at CICS is a structured and scalable research experience program for early undergraduates studying computer science and informatics. The program aims to create a diverse and supportive community at CICS, with a particular focus on engaging students from groups currently underrepresented in computing, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and indigenous peoples. It is an academic-year, group-based, dual-mentored, research apprenticeship experience. Students are placed into small groups and matched with a faculty advisor from a CICS research center or lab . Students apply during the spring term of their first academic year and are accepted into the program before the end of that semester. During their sophomore year, ERSP students participate in the following two classes: In the fall semester, they take CICS 290A: Introduction to Research in the Discipline (1 cr.) to learn some basic skills and knowledge that are needed to begin a research project. In the spring semester, they enroll in CICS 396x: Independent Study - Directed Research Group (3 cr.) to carry out their proposed research projects in teams. This course may count as a major elective for computer science and informatics majors with UPD approval, subject to program rules that apply to independent study courses. Through ERSP, students have the opportunity to learn about research, improve and apply core computing knowledge, gain skills important to their futures as computer and information scientists, and work closely with our amazing faculty mentors and a supportive group of peers in ERSP. EMBER: Energizing, Mentoring, and Broadening Exposure to Research EMBER (Energizing, Mentoring, and Broadening Exposure to Research) is a cross-institutional 1-credit class for undergraduates studying computer science or informatics at UMass Amherst and Mount Holyoke College, usually taken during junior year. Space permitting, seniors may also take the course. An overarching goal is to make research opportunities available and accessible to students from populations that are underrepresented in computing. The course includes a mini-research module mentored by PhD students where undergraduates carry out real experiments. These 4–5 week research modules are designed to be accessible for students regardless of previous research exposure, and to teach new skills through carrying out research projects. The weekly meetings cover a range of topics, including building networks and community in computing, research methods and skills, strategies for navigating graduate school applications, and developing basic research communication skills. Both writing and presentation skills are practiced so that students can be effective in referencing their EMBER experience in job, fellowship, and/or graduate school application letters. CICS Careers Undergraduate Research Volunteers The Undergraduate Research Volunteer (URV) Program is an opportunity for undergraduate students to pursue real-life applications of research. URVs work in teams of three and are assigned one PhD mentor, affiliated with a CICS Lab. Over the course of this program, teams have worked on projects related to differential privacy, environmental justice, and more. URV alumni have acquired positions in both industry and REUs. Independent Study with CICS Faculty If you become interested in a research area being investigated by a faculty member, we encourage you to reach out to the faculty member to discuss the possibility of undertaking an independent study on a related project. Projects are usually for 3 credits a semester. Very successful independent study projects may lead to a second semester of independent study. Students must check course requirements to assure their  independent study courses fulfill their degree requirements. Commonwealth Honors College Honors Thesis For students in the Commonwealth Honors College, an honors thesis can be a great way to get involved with faculty research. As with an independent study, the student and faculty member must agree on a suitable project. The student, with advice from their faculty mentor, must complete the required Honors College Thesis Application. The honors thesis will take the form of a written report that demonstrates critical thinking, a mastery of disciplinary material, and the communication of complex ideas. For the portfolio, your document will be accompanied by an artifact such as a computer program or invention that embodies the work done for the thesis. The completion of an Honors Thesis concludes with an oral presentation. CICS Undergraduate Research Scholarships These scholarships provide financial support to a limited number of students to pursue a research project under the direction of one or more CICS faculty members. These projects can be pursued as independent study courses, as an honors thesis for students in the Commonwealth Honors college, or as full-time summer or part-time academic-year paid positions. Priority will be given to students from minoritized groups in computing (i.e., Black, LatinX, women, LGBTQIA, Native Americans, or Pacific Islanders). Priority will also be given to projects that are addressing important societal issues and are aimed at improving the common good. National Research Opportunities for CICS Undergraduates Summer REU Programs Summer is a great time to engage in research. The National Science Foundation’s REU program funds summer research opportunities in computing at over 90 sites for US citizens or permanent residents. The Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation (CRA-WP) Distributed REU (DREU) program provides funding for research with faculty members across the US for students from underrepresented groups in computing, and has some limited opportunities for international students.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Undergrad_New_Student_Info_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/content/info-new-students,"Undergraduate FAQ You may also find it useful to look through the UMass Registrar's FAQ on grades and classes. General Questions Q: How do I receive permission to enroll in more than 19 credits in a single semester? A: You can appeal for ""credit overload"" to the college's academic advising office . Q: What are the requirements for a high school senior who is enrolling in Computer Science at UMass Amherst? A: You first need to be admitted to the university and express an interest in the major.  The admissions department then decides whether to admit you directly into the major -- usually this requires that you do well in high school precalculus as well as meeting the general requirements for admission to the university.  There are also limited places for students admitted to other majors to join the CS major after they arrive on campus. Q: I have AP credit from high school. How do I figure out what courses at UMass I can get credit for given the exam score? A: UMass has a standard list of AP equivalencies that you should check. Q: I took the language placement test in language x . How do I find out my grade? Whom do I contact to interpret what the grade means? A: You can check your grade on Spire once it is available. Or call the New Students Program for your score, and you should talk to the x department about what course would be appropriate to start in. Q: I have taken, or would like to take, some classes at another university and I would like to transfer the credit to UMass. Is there a list of classes that are already approved? A: Yes we have a short list for colleges on our Transfer Credit Evaluation (TCE) webpage. If there is a course you have taken, or a university or college that is not listed, follow the TCE Process to have courses reviewed. See a question below on just how many courses you can transfer in. Residency requirements vary by program. Q : I'm interested in getting into the gaming industry. What track should I join? A : We do not have a specific track in gaming, however, a number of our students have gone on to work in the gaming industry. Gaming is a broad collection of CS topics, and fortunately, we do offer the right courses to cover them. You should complete the set using the General Computer Science track. Specifically, we suggest: CS320 Software Engineering, CS325 Human Computer Interaction, CS373 Computer Graphics, CS377 Operating Systems, CS383 Artifical Intelligence, CS453 Computer Networking, and CS529 Software Eng Project Management. Also Physics 151 and 152 as your lab science requirement. There are usually other relevant courses offered as well. We've also recently offered CS491IP Programming the iPhone and iPad, and have had courses in Flash and multimedia topics. We also suggest minoring in Art (contact  Prof Galvis-Assmus) or at least taking Art Dept courses in digital graphic design. CICS Laptop requirements Q: What are laptop requirements for CICS students? A : Visit this link for recommended laptop specifications as well as hardware and software notes. The CS Minor Q: I am interested in the computer science minor. How much math experience do I need? A : There is no specific mathematics requirement for the computer science minor, but all the courses require R1 proficiency (such as MATH 104). It's true that COMPSCI 240 and 250 require MATH 132 as prerequisite. MATH 131 and MATH 132 are thus recommended, but students without those math courses can still complete the minor by taking other ""core"" CS courses COMPSCI 220 and COMPSCI 230. Q: Is the minor really only 5 classes? I thought it was 10 classes? A: It used to be 10 classes, but we revised the program. If you are in the old program, in almost all cases, it's strictly easier to complete the 5-course minor. Q: Can I take classes in another department to complete the CS Minor? A : Yes and No. You may transfer in equivalent courses for CICS 160 or 210 taken at another university. But the three upper-level (200+) courses of a minor must be courses taken in our department. Classes taken at the Five Colleges do not count towards this residency requirement. The BS-CS degree Q: How many classes can I transfer into the BS? A :  For the BS-CS, 5 of your 8 electives must be taken at UMass Amherst.  Five College and study abroad courses do not count toward this 5-course residency requirement, but may count toward the 3 remaining electives. The CS LAB Science Requirement for the BS Q: Can the two 4-credit ""science"" classes that I need to take be in two different departments. A : Yes. For example, you can take Chem 111 (4cr) and Physics 151 ( 3cr) and Physics153 Lab (1cr ) for a total of 8 credits. See details approved courses for the CS Lab Science Requirement . Q:  If BIOL 151 can be used to satisfy one of my CS Science Requirements based on the Biology Variance, then why can't I enroll? A: There are only certain majors allowed to enroll in BIOL 151/152 and unfortunately, CS is not one of them.  The CS Curriculum and Undergraduate Program Committees allows a Biology Variance for students who entered the major after May 2014.  While Biology courses are not required for the CS Lab Science Requirement, we allow options to use BIOL 151, 152, and 153. Q:  My ARR doesn't show any Biology courses acceptable for the CS Lab Science Requirement, but the CS webpage says I can take BIOL 151/152/153 (9 credits) for two CS Lab Science Requirement courses.  Why does my ARR not show these courses as options for the CS Lab Science Requirement? A: Students must take BIOL 151, 152, and 153 (lab) for a total of 9 credits, to satisfy two CS Lab Science courses. Students may email upd@cs.umass.edu to request an ARR fix after completing all three courses, although it is not necessary.  We look for these courses when the CS Lab Science Requirement is not satisfied and the ARR will be fixed when clearing students for graduation. Q: What courses can I use for the CS Lab Science Requirement for the BS? A: Science requirements for the BS degree must be 4 credit courses that:  (1) count toward major requirements in the sponsoring department; and (2) includes a laboratory component.  Courses that meet this requirement are listed on the B.S. Requirements page. Students normally select two courses from this list---mixing departments is acceptable. Petitions for variances in the lab science requirement require the student to submit documentation to the UPD (upd@cs.umass.edu) that demonstrates that the alternate course meets the lab science requirement. Integrative Experience Requirement Q: Can I count either COMPSCI 320 or 326 as both IE and toward an upper level CS Elective? A: Yes. Q: Can I count a COMPSCI 320 or 326 equivalent taken elsewhere for the IE Requirement? A: No.  You must take either COMPSCI 320 or 326 here at UMass Amherst to satisfy the IE Requirment. Q: Can I count another major's IE course for the CS Major? A: No.  All primary CS Majors must take either COMPSCI 320 or 326 to satisfy the IE Requirement.  Double majors who want to use another department's IE course must switch CS to a secondary major. Internships Q: I'm doing an internship related to CS and I want to get credit for my internship.  Is that possible? A: Credited internships are available with select industry partners only. See the CICS Careers Guide to Internships for more information . Graduate School Q: I am interested in graduate studies in Computer Science. How do I find out more? A: A good first step in finding out about graduate school in Computer Science is to visit the new website on undergraduate research and graduate school for students, mentors, and advisors . After reviewing this site you should make an appointment with you advisor for guidance on how to apply and which graduate schools would be suitable for you.

C:\Users\vivie\499-Thesis\CICS_Web_Raw_HTML\Undergraduate_Admissions_RAW.html,https://www.cics.umass.edu/admissions/prospective-undergraduates,"Undergraduate Preparation The most important qualification for graduate study in Computer Science is good undergraduate preparation. Course Preparation The more related courses, and the better the performance in those courses, the more likely the student is to compete successfully for admission to the program. However, if a student's performance overall convinces the admissions committee of his/her qualification for graduate study, minor deficiencies in undergraduate preparation are acceptable, provided these deficiencies are removed during the first year in Graduate School. Incoming students should have taken courses equivalent to: * CICS 110: Foundations of Programming * CICS 160: Object Oriented Programming * CICS 210: Data Structures * COMPSCI 230: Computer Systems and Principles * COMPSCI 250: Introduction to Computation * MATH 131: Calculus I * MATH 132: Calculus II * MATH 235: Introduction to Linear Algebra * MATH 233: Multivariate Calculus OR Statistics I We receive many inquiries from prospective students with little or no undergraduate preparation in computer science. In most cases, we recommend that such students enroll as non-degree students here or elsewhere to learn the undergraduate core of computer science. A year spent in this fashion allows students to discover whether they do indeed have the requisite skills and deep interest in computer science, and it provides us with the necessary data to determine whether they qualify for admission to the graduate program. We occasionally make exceptions to this rule but only if a student wishes to pursue interdisciplinary studies in computer science and has shown exceptional ability in a complementary discipline such as math, electrical engineering, physics, linguistics, neuroscience or psychology. Research Preparation We highly recommend that students applying to the MS/PhD or PhD program avail themselves of opportunities to engage in research projects, especially where the work will result in publication of a conference or journal paper. These can, for example, be faculty-supervised research projects, company internships, the many Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs that are sponsored by the National Science Foundation through colleges and universities, or the Computing Research Association's Distributed REU summer programs. The PhD is a research-oriented degree, and the best way to demonstrate potential for completing it is through active and successful participation in research as an undergraduate.
